However, their validity is limited, because the aversive stimuli (e.g., electric shocks) typically lack the modalities and complexity of real-world aversive experiences. To overcome this limitation, we examined fear acquisition, extinction and contextual renewal using an audiovisual unconditioned stimulus (US). Method On day 1, 50 healthy participants completed an acquisition phase in a specific context (i.e., desk or bookcase, ‘context A’). Pictures of colored lamps served as conditioned stimuli and an aversive film clip was used as US. On day 2, extinction took place in the same context (‘context A’) or in a different context (‘context B’). Afterwards, renewal was tested in the acquisition context (AAA vs. ABA design). Results As hypothesized, fear acquisition and extinction, as measured by US expectancy ratings, fear potentiated startle (FPS), and skin conductance responses (SCRs), were successful. Most importantly, conditioned responding was renewed on all measures in the ABA condition, but not in the AAA condition. Differential renewal (i.e., larger renewal for CS + than for CS-) was only observed for US expectancy ratings. Limitations The return of conditioned responses was non-differential for FPS and SCR. Conclusions The current set-up enables investigation of fear renewal using an audiovisual US. Future studies can utilize this paradigm to investigate interventions that aim to reduce fear renewal by modifying the US memory, such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and imagery rescripting.","2019-12-01","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2019-06-26 19:37:15","101493","","","65","","Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/pzu7s/","","","","","Extinction; Return of fear; Fear conditioning; Aversive film clip; Renewal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In three experiments, we investigated whether this is also the case for voice identity learning. In Experiment 1a, we contrasted high variability training sets – which included stimuli extracted from a number of different recording sessions, speaking environments and speaking styles – with low variability stimulus sets that only included a single speaking style (read speech) extracted from one recording session (see Ritchie & Burton, 2017 for faces). Listeners were tested on an old/new recognition task using read sentences (i.e. test materials fully overlapped with the low variability training stimuli) and we found a high variability disadvantage. In Experiment 1b, listeners were trained in a similar way, however, now there was no overlap in speaking style or recording session between training sets and test stimuli. Here, we found a high variability advantage. In Experiment 2, variability was manipulated in terms of the number of unique items as opposed to number of unique speaking styles. Here, we contrasted the high variability training sets used in Experiment 1a with low variability training sets that included the same breadth of styles, but fewer unique items; instead, individual items were repeated (see Murphy, Ipser, Gaigg, & Cook, 2015 for faces). We found only weak evidence for a high variability advantage, which could be explained by stimulus-specific effects. We propose that high variability advantages may be particularly pronounced when listeners are required to generalise from trained stimuli to different-sounding, previously unheard stimuli. We discuss these findings in the context of mechanisms thought to underpin advantages for high variability training.","2019-12-01","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2019-08-27 15:35:36","104026","","","193","","Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/7xvjw","","","","","High variability training; Person perception; Voice identity; Voice learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to advance our understanding of the presumed relationship between SSS and food variety. Participants (N = 30) received two meals on two separate days, one consisting of only two food items (A and B; low variety), and the other comprising six foods (A, B, C, D, E, and F; high variety). Each meal comprised signalled exposure (look-smell-taste-swallow) to a total of 10 bite-size portions: 5 portions of foods A and B in the low variety condition, and 5 portions of A and a single portion of foods B, C, D, E, and F in the high variety condition. Participants tasted 8 food items before and after each meal (i.e., the 6 foods included in the meals plus 2 more unconsumed foods G and H). It was hypothesized that SSS for food A would develop irrespective of overall meal variety, but that SSS for food B would be smaller in the high variety session. The results of this study were in accordance with this hypothesis: strong SSS was present for food A in both meal varieties. For food B, it was present in the low variety meal, but absent in the high variety meal. This indicates that meal variety does not necessarily affect SSS. SSS is strictly determined by degree and timing of sensory exposure to a food. Exposure time should therefore be targeted when developing strategies to influence the development of sensory-specific satiation, which in its turn can affect food intake.","2019-12-01","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2020-10-18 17:37:15","2019-08-27 15:22:09","103740","","","78","","Food Quality and Preference","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/gdr6n","","","","","Satiation; Liking; Sensory-specific satiety; Variety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms by which this combined intervention works are unclear. Our objective was to estimate how much of the effect of a physiotherapist-directed exercise and advice intervention on pain and disability is mediated via changes in depressive symptoms. Methods Causal mediation analysis of a randomized controlled trial. We measured our hypothesized mediator - depressive symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21) at 6 weeks, and the outcomes - pain (numerical rating scale) and disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) at 3 months, estimating the average causal mediation effect (ACME), average direct effect (ADE), and total effect. We pre-specified a causal model to identify potential confounders of the mediator-outcome effect and conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the ACME under varying levels of unknown confounding. Results Data from 240 patients were analyzed (average age 50.5 (SD 15.6) years, 52% male, median depressive symptoms score 4). The effect of exercise combined with advice was not mediated via depressive symptoms: ACME on pain (0.05, 95%CI -0.24 to 0.15), ACME on disability (−0.10, 95%CI -0.59 to 0.38). However depressive symptoms were associated with pain (regression coefficient 0.06; SE 0.03)) and disability (regression coefficient 0.17; SE 0.05).) Conclusions Depressive symptoms did not mediate the effect of exercise and/or advice in this sample.

We examined whether variations in how DCS has been administered can account for this “declining effect”. We also investigated the association between DCS administration characteristics and treatment outcome to find optimal dosing parameters. We conducted a secondary analysis of individual participant data obtained from 1047 participants in 21 studies testing the efficacy of DCS-augmented exposure treatments. Different outcome measures in different studies were harmonized to a 0-100 scale. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that, in participants randomized to DCS augmentation (n = 523), fewer DCS doses, later timing of DCS dose, and lower baseline severity appear to account for this decline effect. More DCS doses were related to better outcomes, but this advantage leveled-off at nine doses. Administering DCS more than 60 minutes before exposures was also related to better outcomes. These predictors were not significant in the placebo arm (n = 521). Results suggested that optimal DCS administration could increase pre-to-follow-up DCS effect size by 50%.

Participants were 142 6–to–7–year–old children, of which 127 returned when they were 8–to–9 years old.

Especially female redheads are known to suffer higher pain sensitivity and higher incidence of some disorders, including skin cancer, Parkinson’s disease and endometriosis. Recently, an explorative study performed on 7,000 subjects showed that both male and female redheads score worse on many health-related variables and express a higher incidence of cancer. Here, we ran the preregistered study on a population of 4,117 subjects who took part in an anonymous electronic survey. We confirmed that the intensity of hair redness negatively correlated with physical health, mental health, fecundity and sexual desire, and positively with the number of kinds of drugs prescribed by a doctor currently taken, and with reported symptoms of impaired mental health. It also positively correlated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, most strongly with learning disabilities disorder and phobic disorder in men and general anxiety disorder in women. However, most of these associations disappeared when the darkness of skin was included in the models, suggesting that skin fairness, not hair redness, is responsible for the associations. We discussed two possible explanations for the observed pattern, the first based on vitamin D deficiency due to the avoidance of sunbathing by subjects with sensitive skin, including some redheads, and second based on folic acid depletion in fair skinned subjects, again including some (a different subpopulation of) redheads. It must be emphasized, however, that both of these explanations are only hypothetical as no data on the concentration of vitamin D or folic acid are available for our subjects. Our results, as well as the conclusions of current reviews, suggest that the new empirical studies on the concentration of vitamin D and folic acids in relation to skin and hair pigmentation are urgently needed.","2019-12-02","2020-10-18 17:37:14","2020-10-18 17:37:14","2020-03-20 14:54:41","1-13","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  https://osf.io/f67m8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested this prediction using the isolation effect (when recall is better for distinct items relative to nondistinct items). Participants had to remember lists of items (words) and, in most cases, were told that they could rely on an external store. On one trial, this expectation was violated, and participants had to unexpectedly rely on their internal/biological memory.

Similarly, the control of visual attention often entails preventing initial distraction by irrelevant but tempting (goal-similar) objects, and disengaging attention when it has been inappropriately captured. Given these similarities, we examined whether individuals higher versus lower in trait self-control would differ in their susceptibility to attention capture using mouse-tracking as a sensitive, online measure of how attentional dynamics resolve over time and space in response to a distracting visual cue. Using a variety of metrics of attention capture, we found that differences among people in trait self-control did not predict initial selection of visual information nor subsequent disengagement.

One approach to measuring competency is through standardized role plays. Role plays have the benefits of standardization and reliance on observed behavior rather than written knowledge. However, role plays are also resource intensive and dependent upon inter-rater reliability. We undertook a two-part scoping review to describe how competency is conceptualized in studies evaluating the relationship of competency with client outcomes. We focused on use of role plays including achieving inter-rater reliability and the association with client outcomes. First, we identified 4 reviews encompassing 61 studies evaluating the association of competency with client outcomes. Second, we identified 39 competency evaluation tools, of which 21 were used in comparisons with client outcomes. Inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) was reported for 15 tools and ranged from 0.53 to 0.96 (mean ICC = 0.77). However, we found that none of the outcome comparison studies measured competency with standardized role plays. Instead, studies typically used therapy quality (i.e., session ratings with actual clients) as a proxy for competency. This reveals a gap in the evidence base for competency and its role in predicting client outcomes.

To more precisely estimate this effect, we conducted a quasi-exact behavioural replication of a recent study from our lab, which found that post-training eyes-closed waking rest improved declarative memory relative to a distractor task. Contrary to our hypothesis, the observed effect was not significant; however, it did fall within the 95% confidence interval of our previous finding. Furthermore, a meta-analytic effect summarizing n = 10 similar studies indicates a moderately sized and significant benefit of waking rest for verbal memory (d = 0.38, p < 0.001). We argue that the apparently conflicting results in this literature are most parsimoniously explained by variability due to sampling and/or measurement error, in a group of studies often underpowered to detect a smaller-than-expected effect of rest. Additionally, exploratory analyses revealed that increased trait daydreaming frequency negatively correlated with memory retention during eyes-closed rest. Together with our replication and meta-analysis, these studies suggest that waking rest confers a small but significant benefit on memory consolidation, and that this benefit requires the mind to be free from attention to either external tasks or spontaneous thought.","2019-12-18","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-04-29 20:38:05","1-9","","1","9","","","Resting States and Memory Consolidation","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity to transmit, store and compute information has increased greatly over recent history, and the new media environment may encourage partisanship (i.e. ‘echo chambers’), misinformation and rumour spreading to support political and social causes and be conducive both to emotive writing and emotional contagion, which may shape voting behaviour. In our pre-registered experiment, we examined whether implicit associations between facial cues to dominance and competence (intelligence) and leadership ability are strengthened by partisan media and knowledge that leaders support or oppose us on a socio-political issue of personal importance. Social information, in general, reduced well-established implicit associations between facial cues and leadership ability. However, as predicted, social knowledge of group membership reduced preferences for facial cues to high dominance and intelligence in out-group leaders. In the opposite-direction to our original prediction, this ‘in-group bias’ was greater under less partisan versus partisan media, with partisan writing eliciting greater state anxiety across the sample. Partisanship also altered the salience of women’s facial appearance (i.e., cues to high dominance and intelligence) in out-group versus in-group leaders. Independent of the media environment, men and women displayed an in-group bias toward facial cues of dominance in same-sex leaders. Our findings reveal effects of minimal social information (facial appearance, group membership, media reporting) on leadership judgements, which may have implications for patterns of voting or socio-political behaviour at the local or national level.","2020","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-04-30 20:01:55","","","","10","","Front.

Given costly sperm production and the risk of sperm depletion, males should invest strategically in ejaculates. Here, we use the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), where males have a single coercive mating tactic, to test whether the number of cues indicative of female availability affects the rate of sperm available for mating (so-called sperm priming). We also tested whether plasticity in sperm production varies with male body size. We created four socio-sexual treatments that differ in the number of female-derived cues: none, chemical, chemical and visual, and full access to a female. We used ablation surgery, removing the tip of the male gonopodium (intromittent organ), to prevent males from mating with a female in the treatment where they interacted with females. We hypothesized that elevated sperm priming would be associated with more cues about female availability, and be more apparent in smaller, subordinate males due to their lower baseline sperm count (higher risk of sperm depletion) and their potential disadvantage during premating competition (leading to higher marginal benefits from sperm investment). There was, however, no evidence for sperm priming. The rate of sperm availability for mating and the baseline sperm reserves were, however, dependent on male body size. We discuss possible reasons for our findings. We also note that our study provides novel insights into the proximate mechanisms associated with sperm release in Poeciliids. Our confirmation of the fact that removing the gonopodium tip prevents a male from releasing sperm when housed with a female has many potential applications (e.g., in the study of effects of ejaculate investment and mating effort on male mating success and longevity).","2019-12-10","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-04-23 18:27:59","167","","12","73","","Behav Ecol Sociobiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000  https://osf.io/2nu85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structural equation modelling showed that SIFI susceptibility increased with age. This was mediated by visual acuity and self-reported hearing: better scores on these measures predicted reduced and stronger SIFI susceptibility, respectively. Unexpectedly, VTD improved with age and predicted increased SIFI susceptibility. Importantly, the relationship between age and SIFI susceptibility remained significant, even when considering mediators. A second model showed that, with age, visual ‘gain’ (the benefit of congruent auditory information on visual judgements) was predicted by ATD: better ATD predicted stronger visual gain. However, neither age nor SIFI susceptibility were directly associated with visual gain. Our findings illustrate, in the largest sample of older adults to date, how multisensory perception is influenced, but not fully accounted for, by age-related changes in unisensory abilities.","2019-12-18","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-10-18 17:37:13","2020-04-29 20:38:36","1-12","","1","9","","","Age-related sensory decline mediates the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the details underlying this process remain largely unexplored. Based on past literature, set-point theory, and results from an exploratory sample, we investigated empirically how first childbirth affected satisfaction with specific domains of life. In a preregistered study, we compared parents with matched childless respondents in their trajectories of life satisfaction, and also satisfaction with family life, health, sleep, work, housework, leisure, dwelling, household income, and personal income. First-time parents and childless respondents were matched in a procedure combining exact and propensity score matching. Using the population-representative German SOEP data (N = 3,370), longitudinal multilevel models revealed heterogeneous effects of childbirth on different domains of satisfaction: Both mothers' and fathers' satisfaction with family life increased temporarily in a similar fashion to life satisfaction before going back to baseline within five years after childbirth. However, only mothers experienced drastic losses to satisfaction with sleep and satisfaction with personal income. For the remaining domains, parents' satisfaction largely resembled that of the matched childless respondents. These divergent domain trajectories underscore the need for multivariate analyses in life satisfaction research.

In the present research, accordingly, we conducted a highly powered, preregistered study (N = 579) to identify which barriers uniquely predict openness to going vegetarian. We focused specifically on anticipated vegetarian stigma, given recent qualitative evidence highlighting this attitude as an influential barrier. That is, do meat-eaters resist going vegetarian because they fear that following a vegetarian diet would make them feel stigmatized? Being of younger age, more politically conservative, White, and residing in a rural community predicted greater anticipated vegetarian stigma among meat-eaters. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses converged, however, to suggest that anticipated vegetarian stigma was not a significant predictor of openness to going vegetarian. The strongest predictors of openness were perceived tastiness and perceived healthfulness of vegetarian dieting. These factors—but not anticipated stigma—furthermore explained why men (compared to women) and political conservatives (compared to liberals) were particularly resistant to going vegetarian.","2020-01-01","2020-10-18 17:37:12","2020-10-18 17:37:12","2020-01-28 19:20:19","104469","","","144","","Appetite","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/pgjq6?view_only=e6c867af7ff44cc8a6b65d451f751e22","","","","","Identity; Stigma; Barriers; Food choice; Vegetarianism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current work for the first time, we used fMRI with faces as stimuli in the CAT paradigm, focusing on face-selective brain regions. We found a behavioral change effect of CAT with faces immediately and 1-month after training, however face-selective regions were not indicative of behavioral change and thus preference change is less likely to rely on face processing brain regions. Nevertheless, we found that during training, fMRI activations in the ventral striatum were correlated with individual preference change. We also found a correlation between preference change and activations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the binary choice phase.

Consistent with this proposal, results from three studies (N = 1097) suggest that American adults perceive typical breakfast foods as particularly well suited for breakfast and believe that more nutritious alternatives consumed at lunch or dinner are less appropriate for breakfast. As a result, people are unwilling to add more nutritious alternatives to their breakfast repertoire. To counter this rigidity, we devised an intervention passage emphasizing that (1) many foods became breakfast staples because of intensive marketing campaigns, and that (2) people in other cultures readily include lunch or dinner foods on their breakfast plate. This approach effectively revised people's beliefs about breakfast foods, and improved their motivation to adopt a healthier breakfast diet.

There was no clear evidence that N-back (MD −0.25, 95% CI: −1.45 to 0.94), delay discounting (MD 0.01, 95% CI: -0.002 to 0.004) or dot probe performance (MD −0.49, 95% CI: −1.61 to −0.64) were sensitive to NRT. Conclusions Findings from two experiments converge to suggest that abstinence in smokers reliably increases ambulatory craving assessments and, to a lesser extent, decreases go/no-go task performance. These findings can be utilized in the development of an experimental medicine model to test novel treatments for smoking cessation.","2020-01-01","2020-10-18 17:37:12","2020-10-18 17:37:12","2020-03-05 21:28:39","107720","","","206","","Drug and Alcohol Dependence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/apsjx","","","","","Smoking cessation; Ecological momentary assessment; Tobacco abstinence; Cognitive performance; Experimental medicine model; Tobacco withdrawal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-distancing was expected to reduce the negative biases associated with depression by minimizing self-relevance through taking the perspective of an objective other. We hypothesized that when thinking about a past experience of help-seeking, a selfdistancing prompt would cause increased help-seeking intentions and more favorable help-seeking outcome expectations. The influence of selfdistancing on the self-stigma of help-seeking was also explored. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to write (Studies 1 and 3) or watch a video (Study 2) where they were prompted to think about helpseeking from their own perspective or an objective other's perspective. Studies 2 and 3 were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework. Results In Study 1, self-distancing increased help-seeking intentions but did not influence help-seeking expectations or self-stigma. The a priori hypotheses were not supported in Study 2 or 3. However, exploratory analyses of Study 3 revealed an interaction between condition and level of depressive symptomatology indicating that the distancing condition weakened the relationship between higher levels of depressive symptomatology and lower help-seeking intentions, and between higher levels of depressive symptomatology and higher self-stigma. Additionally, analyses of written responses indicated participants in the distancing condition were significantly less likely to write responses void of positive content. Conclusion Although a priori hypotheses were not supported, further research is warranted as results indicate the potential for using self-distancing approaches to increasing help-seeking among some people with depressive symptomatology.","2020-01-01","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-03-20 13:41:10","112700","","","245","","Social Science & Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/r45uw","","","","","Depression; Help-seeking; Self-distancing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Part 1 of the current study, we conducted a descriptive review of relevant articles from the past two years of NeuroImage in order to identify the most commonly used covariates in work of this nature. Age, sex, and intracranial volume were found to be the most commonly used covariates, although the number of covariates used ranged from 0 to 14, with 37 different covariate sets across the 68 models tested. In Part 2, we used data from the Human Connectome Project to investigate the degree to which the addition of common covariates altered the relations between individual difference variables (i.e., personality traits, psychopathology, cognitive tasks) and regional gray matter volume (GMV), as well as the statistical significance of values associated with these effect sizes. Using traditional and random sampling approaches, our results varied widely, such that some covariate sets influenced the relations between the individual difference variables and GMV very little, while the addition of other covariate sets resulted in a substantially different pattern of results compared to models with no covariates. In sum, these results suggest that the use of covariates should be critically examined and discussed as part of the conversation on replicability in structural neuroimaging. We conclude by recommending that researchers pre-register their analytic strategy and present information on how relations differ based on the inclusion of covariates.","2020-01-15","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-01-28 19:30:20","116225","","","205","","NeuroImage","The quandary of covarying","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/anvfx/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67","","","","","Individual differences; Covariate; Analytic flexibility; Pre-registration; Structural MRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Female participants (n = 60) were given a 635 kcal lunch of sandwiches, crisps and grapes. Those allocated to an experimental condition were asked to attend to the sensory properties of the food. After lunch, all participants were given 908 kcal of three energy dense sweet snack foods and asked to taste and rate them on several dimensions. Unknown to participants, the amounts of all foods consumed were recorded. Before they left the laboratory, participants in the experimental group were also asked to continue to pay attention to the sensory properties of their food for the rest of the day. At the end of the day all participants logged onto a website where they completed a suspicion probe and surprise online food recall measure to assess food intake outside the laboratory. Data from participants who guessed their eating was being measured were excluded.

To contribute to a convergent cognitive neuroscience of creativity, we conducted a pre-registered conceptual replication and extension study in which we assessed previously reported predictors of creativity using a multimodal approach, incorporating volumetric, white matter, and functional connectivity neuroimaging data. We assessed sets of pre-registered predictors against prevailing measures of creativity, including visual and verbal tests of divergent thinking, everyday creative behaviour, and creative achievement. We then conducted whole-brain exploratory analyses. Greater creativity was broadly predicted by features of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobe (IPL), including both local grey matter and white matter predictors in the IFG, the superior longitudinal fasciculus that connects them, and IFG-IPL functional connectivity. As IFG and IPL are important nodes within executive control and default mode networks (DMN), respectively, this result supports the view that executive modulation of DMN activity optimizes creative ideation. Furthermore, white matter integrity of the basal ganglia was also a generalizable creativity predictor, and exploratory analyses revealed the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and the parahippocampal gyrus to both be reliable predictors of creativity across neuroimaging modalities. This pattern aligns with proposals ascribing roles of working and long-term memory to problem-solving and imagination. Overall, our findings help to consolidate some, but not all, neural correlates of individual differences that have been discussed in the cognitive neuroimaging of creativity, yielding a subset that appear particularly promising for focused future investigation.","2020-02-01","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-03-03 19:58:15","116292","","","206","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/uzhvm","","","","","Individual differences; Memory; Neuroimaging; Executive function; Creativity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear if competition or facilitation effects will be observed at the level of sensory cortex when attending to competing stimuli in two modalities. The present study used electroencephalogram (EEG) and frequency-tagging to quantitatively assess auditory-visual interactions during sustained multimodal sensory stimulation. The emotional content of a 6.66 Hz rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) was manipulated to elicit well-established emotional attention effects, while a constant 63 dB tone with a 40.8 Hz modulation served as a concurrent auditory stimulus in two experiments. As a directed attention manipulation, participants were instructed to detect transient sound level events in the auditory stream in Experiment 1. To manipulate attention through threat anticipation, participants were instructed to expect an aversive noise burst after a higher 40.8 Hz modulated tone in Experiment 2. Each stimulus evoked reliable steady-state sensory cortical responses in all participants (n = 30) in both experiments. The visual cortical responses were modulated by the auditory detection task, but not by threat anticipation: Visual responses were smaller during auditory streams with a transient target as compared to uninterrupted auditory streams. Conversely, visual stimulus condition had no significant effects on auditory sensory cortical responses in either experiment. These results indicate that there is neither a competition nor facilitation effect of visual content on concurrent auditory sensory cortical processing. They further indicate that competition effects of auditory stream content on sustained visuocortical responses are limited to auditory target processing.","2020-01-01","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-10-18 17:37:11","2020-03-20 13:41:45","107283","","","136","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/2dyj4 and https://osf.io/wjptd","","","","","Attention; Emotion; Intermodal interactions; Steady-state visual evoked potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current investigation examines the effect of specific and general rules on unethical behavior and how this effect depends on personal gain resulting from the unethical behavior. The results of three preregistered experiments suggest that both specific and general rules counteract the increase in unethical behavior induced by high personal gain. Although the results were not fully consistent across all studies, specific rules appear more successful in doing this than general rules. In Studies 1 and 3, when personal gain from unethical behavior was (extremely) high, specific rules were more successful in reducing unethical behavior than were general rules. Results of Study 2 suggest that the larger effect of specific rules (compared to general rules) is caused by specific rules preventing people from engaging in moral rationalizations that justify their unethical behavior. A meta-analysis across all studies confirms this overall pattern.

We first manipulated perceived issue polarization between two candidates in a fictional election to be high, medium, or low and showed that the high and low polarization conditions, compared to the medium condition, evoked greater desire for inclusion of a third candidate. Then we established that perceiving the electoral system as broken statistically mediated the effect of high and low polarization on greater desire for inclusion. We next demonstrated experimental mediation in two ways: via a manipulation-of-mediator design (Pirlott & MacKinnon, 2016) in which we manipulated the proposed mediator (i.e., perceived electoral system brokenness) and, separately, via a moderation-of process design (Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005) in which we simultaneously manipulated both perceived polarization and perceived brokenness. Both perceived issue polarization (high and low versus medium, and high versus low, excluding medium) and perceived brokenness exert causal effects on greater desire for inclusion of a third party candidate. When people perceive high and low issue polarization and when people perceive brokenness in the electoral system they support actions that pose potential fixes to the brokenness, such as including a third-party or independent candidate in elections.","2020-03-01","2020-10-18 17:37:10","2020-10-18 17:37:10","2020-03-19 19:21:13","103914","","","87","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Dealing with government dysfunction","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/fdwmq/files/?view_only=4fafbea33e0b4df9b5cb03b68da9b848","","","","","Polarization; Political behavior; Political psychology; Third parties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a preregistered experiment, we found that participants (n=300) provided higher truth ratings for statements accompanied by solved anagrams even if the facts were false, and the effect was particularly pronounced when participants reported an Aha! experience (d = .629). Recent work suggests that feelings of insight usually accompany correct ideas.

Until recently, these two accounts have been difficult to extricate experimentally, but the development of humanoid robots provides a novel test. Here we document that children overimitate robots, but to a lesser degree than humans and regardless of whether the redundant actions are seen to be ritualistic or functional.

Through two highly powered preregistered studies (Ns = 890 and 1775) of self-identified vegetarians, combining both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, I found that men and women differ along two dimensions of vegetarian identity: (1) dietary motivation and (2) dietary adherence. Compared to vegetarian men, vegetarian women reported that they are more prosocially motivated to follow their diet and adhere to their diet more strictly (i.e., are less likely to cheat and eat meat).

For example, a letter is more easily detected in a word when it corresponds to a simple grapheme (e.g., A in PLACE) than when it is embedded in a complex one (e.g., A in BEACH). Such effects have been taken as a demonstration that graphemes are processed as perceptual units by the reading system. However, this conclusion has been recently challenged by studies using different experimental designs. In the present study, we used four experimental situations to get a clearer picture of the reliability of graphemic effects. We used four types of tasks: letter detection (Experiment 1), length estimation (Experiment 2), mixing case lexical decision (Experiment 3), and primed lexical decision (Experiments 4 and 5). In each task, the processing of words with complex graphemes (e.g., BEACH) was compared to the processing of words with simple graphemes (e.g., PLACE). Overall, we found no reliable grapheme effect, supporting the claim that graphemes are not perceptual units in skilled visual word recognition.

The most commonly used classification to rate bone defects in this setting, the Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute classification, does not quantify diaphyseal bone loss and reliability has not been well studied.         Questions/purposes          We developed a new classification scheme to rate bone defects in patients undergoing revision TKA and tested (1) the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of this classification for revision TKA based on preoperative radiographs, and (2) whether additional CT images might improve interobserver reliability.         Methods          This was a preregistered observational study. Interobserver reliability was analyzed using preoperative radiographs of 61 patients who underwent (repeat) revision TKA, and their bone defects were rated by five experienced orthopaedic surgeons. For intraobserver reliability, ratings were repeated at least 2 weeks after the first rating (Timepoints 1 and 2). Directly after the radiographic assessments of Timepoint 2, the observers were provided with CT images of each patient and asked to rate the bone defects for a third time (Timepoint 3), to assess the additional value of CT. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability were tested using Gwet’s agreement coefficient 2, which is a measure of agreement between observers in categorical data. Substantial agreement was defined as coefficients between 0.61 to 0.8 and almost perfect agreement as > 0.8.         Results          The intraobserver reliability varied between 0.55 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.71) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) in the epiphysis, between 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1) in the metaphysis, and between 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 1) in the diaphysis. The interobserver reliability varied between 0.48 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.57) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.56) in the epiphysis and between 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.87) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.93) in the metaphysis, and was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) in the diaphysis at Timepoint 1. The interobserver reliability at Timepoint 2 was similar to that of Timepoint 1. The addition of CT images did not improve reliability (Timepoint 3).         Conclusions          The bone defect classification was less reliable in the epiphyseal area compared with the metaphysis and diaphysis. This finding may be explained by prosthetic components obscuring this region or the more severe bone defects in this region. The addition of CT scans did not improve reliability. Further testing of reliability with observers from other institutions is necessary, as well as validity testing, by testing the classification in relation to intraoperative findings.

A new scale to measure belief in neuromyths and cognitive enhancement was developed and validated. Belief in neuromyths was related to a more intuitive (compared to an analytical) thinking style, a stronger need for cognitive closure, a simpler view of epistemic cognition, endorsement of a fixed mindset, and it was inversely related to scientific literacy. Belief in cognitive enhancement was specifically related to the endorsement of a growth mindset. No clear effect of the presence or absence of brain pictures on credibility ratings for neuroscientific explanations and intuitive thinking was found.

Additionally, prior research has not tested whether healthy comfort eating of fruits and vegetables might also alleviate stress, or whether comfort eating during the stress anticipation phase versus immediately after a stressful event is more beneficial for stress relief. The present experiment tested whether unhealthy and healthy comfort eating reduce acute psychophysiological responses to a socially evaluative stressor. Participants (N = 150 healthy women) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test in the lab and were randomly assigned to one of five conditions according to a 2 (food type: unhealthy vs. healthy) x 2 (eating timing: during stress anticipation vs. after the stressor) + 1 (no food control) between-subjects design. Stress outcomes included mood, cognitive appraisals, rumination, salivary cortisol, heart rate variability, and pre-ejection period. Unhealthy and healthy comfort eating did not dampen reactivity or enhance recovery of psychophysiological stress compared to control, and no differences in reactivity or recovery were found by comfort food type. Findings suggest that by replacing unhealthy comfort foods with fruits and vegetables, women will not be sacrificing any stress-reducing benefits and can inherently improve the quality of their diet while avoiding potential drawbacks of unhealthy comfort eating (e.g., links with abdominal obesity).","2019-09-01","2020-10-18 17:37:37","2020-10-18 17:37:37","2019-05-22 14:10:05","26-36","","","107","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Cookie or clementine?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/j95tf/wiki/home/","","","","","Emotion; Stress; Cortisol; Mood; Eating; Comfort eating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, we were interested in the possibility that narcissistic admiration (an agentic form of narcissism) and narcissistic rivalry (an antagonistic form of narcissism) may have divergent associations with influence strategies. Study 1 examined basic associations that narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry had with the use of influence strategies in a sample of 351 undergraduates. Study 2 sought to replicate the results of Study 1 in a more diverse sample of 302 community members. Study 3 examined the associations that narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry had with influence strategies for both members of 77 romantic dyads. The results of these studies indicate that narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry often had similar positive associations with manipulation, whereas narcissistic rivalry also had positive associations with supplication, bullying, autocracy, and disengagement as well as a negative association with bargaining. Discussion will focus on the implications of these results for understanding the connections that narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry have with romantic relationship functioning.","2019-09-01","2020-10-18 17:37:37","2020-10-18 17:37:37","2019-05-22 18:44:30","33-42","","","147","","Personality and Individual Differences","How do narcissists get what they want from their romantic partners?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/ysc93","","","","","Narcissism; Admiration; Influence; Rivalry; Romantic relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the movements of the actual user pairs between the two conditions, and to an artificial “pseudosynchrony” dataset composed of the movements of randomly combined participant pairs who did not actually interact. We found stronger positive and negative correlations between real pairs compared to pseudosynchronous pairs, providing evidence for naturally occurring nonverbal synchrony between pairs in virtual reality.

Some flexitarians, despite eating meat, consider themselves to be vegetarian. Through a preregistered study (N = 837), we investigated how flexitarians express social identity around their diets—namely, how they self-identify on a continuous scale ranging from meat-eater (i.e., omnivorous) to vegetarian. Over and above actual eating behavior, two psychosocial variables emerged as significant predictors of flexitarians’ levels of vegetarian identification: the centrality of meat-reduced dieting to their identity and their beliefs about carnism (the ideology of eating animals). These results suggest that greater consideration of meat-reduced eating behaviors offers promise for elucidating the intersections of social identity and moral judgment.","2019-09-09","2020-10-18 17:37:36","2020-10-18 17:37:36","2019-12-23 16:54:50","1948550619869619","","","","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","Mostly Vegetarian, But Flexible About It","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/4rmut/?view_only=7de9c46f711b43b3926a2d486a97539b","","","","","social identity; flexitarian; food choice; morality; vegetarian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that on tasks with reduced demands, older adults tracked belief to the same extent as younger adults, despite their declining EF. The findings support a model in which age-related decline in ToM ability is primarily caused by compromised EF, not ToM competence, suggesting that underlying ToM mechanisms are still intact in the elderly.

Design Observational study. Setting Menu and nutritional information provided online by major UK restaurant chains. Method During October to November 2018, we accessed websites of restaurant chains with 50 or more outlets in the UK. Menu items that constituted starters, sides or desserts were identified and their kcal content was extracted. Accompanying beverages were not included. We used multilevel modelling to examine whether mean kcal content of dishes differed in fast-food versus full-service restaurants. Main outcome measures The mean kcal content of dishes and the proportion of dishes exceeding public health recommendations for energy content in a main meal (>600 kcal). Results A total of 1009 dishes (212 starters, 318 sides and 479 desserts) from 27 restaurant chains (21 full-service, 6 fast-food) were included. The mean kcal content of eligible dishes was 488.0 (SE=15.6) for starters, 397.5 (SE=14.9) for sides and 430.6 (SE=11.5) for desserts. The percentage of dishes exceeding 600 kcal was 26.4% for starters, 21.7% for sides and 20.5% for desserts. Compared with fast-food chains, desserts offered at full-service restaurants were on average more calorific and were significantly more likely to exceed 600 kcal. Conclusions The average energy content of sides, starters and desserts sold in major UK restaurants is high. One in four starters and one in five sides and desserts in UK chain restaurants exceed the recommended energy intake for an entire meal.","2019-10-01","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2020-02-14 19:58:44","","","10","9","","","A bit or a lot on the side?","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The present research examines the role of working memory in such intuitive coherence judgments. Dual-process models of information processing suggest that intuition does not depend on working memory. Consistent with this, the authors predicted that taxing working memory capacity will not lower the accuracy of intuitive coherence judgments. Nevertheless, taxing working memory may impede metacognitive processing, which may lead people to become more conservative in judging triads as coherent. Two studies (combined N = 307) tested these predictions by asking participants to memorize letter-number combinations of varying lengths while providing intuitive coherence judgments. As expected, working memory load had no effect on the accuracy of intuitive coherence judgments (Studies 1 & 2). Effects on judgment bias were less consistent. In Study 1, participants became slightly more conservative in judging triads as coherent under moderate (compared to low) working memory load. In Study 2, which was preregistered, working memory load led to more conservative intuitive coherence judgments, but only when participants prioritized a highly demanding load task. Unexpectedly, when focusing on a moderate (compared to a low) working memory load, participants were more liberal in judging triads as coherent. Together, these findings indicate that taxing working memory may interfere with people’s inclination to trust their intuition, even when it leaves the accuracy of people’s intuition intact.","2019-10-01","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2019-08-01 17:51:59","103975","","","191","","Cognition","Listening to your intuition in the face of distraction","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/ mgxw5/register/5730e99a9ad5a102c5745a8a https://osf.io/mgxw5/ register/5730e99a9ad5a102c5745a8a","","","","","Working memory; Intuition; Dual-process models; Intuitive coherence judgments; Semantic coherence task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because first-line or second-line treatments, or both, based on chemotherapy and on hormone therapy have been scarcely investigated in head-to-head randomised controlled trials, we aimed to compare these two different approaches. Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis with a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, Web of Science, and online archives of the most relevant international oncology conferences. We included all phase 2 and 3 randomised controlled trials investigating chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies and hormone therapies with or without targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or both, in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017. Additional recently published randomised controlled trials relevant to the topic were also subsequently added. No language restrictions were adopted for our search. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was done to compare hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (the primary outcome), and to compare odds ratios (ORs) for the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (the secondary outcome). All treatments were compared to anastrozole and to palbociclib plus letrozole. This study is registered in the Open Science Framework online public database, registration DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/496VR. Findings We identified 2689 published results and 140 studies (comprising 50 029 patients) were included in the analysis. Palbociclib plus letrozole (HR 0·42; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·25–0·70), ribociclib plus letrozole (0·43; 0·24–0·77), abemaciclib plus anastrozole or letrozole (0·42; 0·23–0·76), palbociclib plus fulvestrant (0·37; 0·23–0·59), ribociclib plus fulvestrant (0·48; 0·31–0·74), abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (0·44; 0·28–0·70), everolimus plus exemestane (0·42; 0·28–0·67), and, in patients with a PIK3CA mutation, alpelisib plus fulvestrant (0·39; 0·22–0·66), and several chemotherapy-based regimens, including anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens, were associated with better progression-free survival than was anastrozole alone. No chemotherapy or hormone therapy regimen was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole for progression-free survival. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was the only clinically relevant regimen that was significantly better than palbociclib plus letrozole in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an overall response (OR 8·95; 95% CrI 1·03–76·92). Interpretation In the first-line or second-line setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies are better than standard hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Moreover, no chemotherapy regimen with or without targeted therapy is significantly better than CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapies in terms of progression-free survival. Our data support treatment guideline recommendations involving the new combinations of hormone therapies plus targeted therapies as first-line or second-line treatments, or in both settings, in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

To address this question, we used a dual-task paradigm: Participants prepared an action (e.g., grasping), while concurrently performing an orientation-change-detection task. We demonstrated that as actions became more fluent (e.g., as grasping errors decreased), perceptual-discrimination performance also improved.

We additionally tested whether planfulness uniquely relates to activity when compared with related constructs. Finally, ratings of participants’ written goals were correlated with these personality traits and physical activity. We found that planfulness was positively associated with average visits to a recreational center, that planfulness explained unique variance in activity, and that planfulness correlated with the descriptiveness of written goals.

These beliefs are not predicted by irrelevant traits. Two mechanisms contribute to humanity’s perennial tendency to denigrate kids: a person-specific tendency to notice the limitations of others where one excels and a memory bias projecting one’s current qualities onto the youth of the past. When observing current children, we compare our biased memory to the present and a decline appears. This may explain why the kids these days effect has been happening for millennia.</p>","2019-10-01","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2020-10-18 17:37:28","2020-02-14 20:47:05","eaav5916","","10","5","","","Kids these days","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Individuals performed a memory task where they could offload to-be-recalled information to an external store and on a critical trial, we surreptitiously manipulated the information in that store. Results demonstrated that individuals rarely noticed this manipulation.

Here we report data from a high-powered study (N = 252) to clarify the relationship between sensorimotor resonance as indexed by mu suppression during action observation and trait empathy as measured by the well-established Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).

An additional non-registered analysis using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to look at the isolated central mu-component clarified the relationship. Results confirmed the lack of a relationship between the mu-component and the perspective taking, personal distress, or fantasy facets of the IRI, but suggest a possible association with empathic concern such that greater resonance is associated with greater empathic concern.

A variety of barriers entrenched in the traditional drug distribution and dispensing model of pharmacy business has continued to challenge the implementation efforts of medication review services worldwide in the community pharmacy setting. Main objectives i) Characterize original research studies that sought to enhance medication review service implementation in community pharmacy settings. ii) Categorize the broader corpus of scientific literature (beyond original implementation studies) on medication review service implementation in community pharmacy settings. Methods A broad systematic search strategy was applied to ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library to create an over-arching view and extensively ordered bibliography of the diverse research publication types dealing with the topic of medication review service implementation in the community pharmacy setting. A scoping review was subsequently conducted on original research studies that utilized various strategies to enhance the implementation of this service in community pharmacies. Data-charting evaluated the location of implementation studies, the strategies undertaken, the scale of implementation strategies, the use of DII (Dissemination, Implementation and Improvement) science theory, sample sizes, and DII outcomes. Results Of 5947 records screened, 419 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (from abstract screening) to be deemed suitable for categorization and inclusion into the broader survey on this topic. Of these 419 publications, only 75 were original research specifically focused on enhancing the implementation of medication reviews in community pharmacy. A large majority of the publications were qualitative studies (n = 203). The remaining articles were improvement studies (n = 36), descriptive observational studies (n = 49), reviews (n = 69) and methodology papers (n = 16). Twenty-nine of these articles were deemed suitable for inclusion in more than one category. After full-text screening, 41 of the 75 implementation publications, representing 40 original studies, published between 1999 and 2019, were eligible for data-charting. The majority of these studies occurred in North America (n = 30), used some form of education as the most common implementation strategy (n = 22) and measured ‘adoption’ (extent or frequency of medication reviews delivered) most frequently as an implementation outcome (n = 30). Just over half of the studies used a multi-faceted implementation strategy (n = 21). Only 9 studies used a theory, model or framework at any point in the research process to test hypotheses or explain empirical findings. Conclusions There is an abundance of publications addressing various issues surrounding medication review implementation in community pharmacies. However, the literature appears disproportionately represented by qualitative studies. There is also a need for more rigorously conducted implementation studies on medication review services in community pharmacy.","2019-10-07","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-02-14 19:32:42","","","","","","Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy","Medication review service implementation in community pharmacy settings","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/ KW9JF","","","","","Implementation; Community pharmacy; Medication review; Professional services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is clear, however, that the pancreatic beta cell is central to T2D pathogenesis.               In vitro               gene-knockout (KO) models to study T2D risk genes have so far focused on rodent beta cells. However, there are important structural and functional differences between rodent and human beta cell lines. With that in mind, we have developed a robust pipeline to create a stable CRISPR/Cas9 KO in an authentic human beta cell line (EndoC-βH1). The KO pipeline consists of a dual lentiviral sgRNA strategy and we targeted three genes (               INS               ,               IDE               ,               PAM               ) as a proof of concept. We achieved a significant reduction in mRNA levels and complete protein depletion of all target genes. Using this dual sgRNA strategy, up to 94 kb DNA were cut out of the target genes and the editing efficiency of each sgRNA exceeded >87.5%. Sequencing of off-targets showed no unspecific editing. Most importantly, the pipeline did not affect the glucose-responsive insulin secretion of the cells. Interestingly, comparison of KO cell lines for               NEUROD1               and               SLC30A8               with siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) approaches demonstrate phenotypic differences.               NEUROD1-               KO cells were not viable and displayed elevated markers for ER stress and apoptosis.               NEUROD1               -KD, however, only had a modest elevation, by 34%, in the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP and a gene expression profile indicative of chronic ER stress without evidence of elevated cell death. On the other hand,               SLC30A8               -KO cells demonstrated no reduction in K               ATP               channel gene expression in contrast to siRNA silencing. Overall, this strategy to efficiently create stable KO in the human beta cell line EndoC-βH1 will allow for a better understanding of genes involved in beta cell dysfunction, their underlying functional mechanisms and T2D pathogenesis.","2019-10-08","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-02-14 19:33:06","150","","","4","","Wellcome Open Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2KYAN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

P600 effects are also often taken as evidence for language-like grammars in non-linguistic domains like music or arithmetic. An alternative account, however, interprets the P600 as a P3, a domain-general brain response to salience. Using time-generalized multivariate pattern analysis, we demonstrate that P3 EEG patterns, elicited in a visual Oddball experiment, account for the P600 effect elicited in a syntactic violation experiment: P3 pattern-trained MVPA can classify P600 trials just as well as P600-trained ones. A second study replicates and generalizes this finding, and demonstrates its specificity by comparing it to face- and semantic mismatch-associated EEG responses. These results indicate that P3 and P600 share neural patterns to a substantial degree, calling into question the interpretation of P600 as a language-specific brain response and instead strengthening its association with the P3. More generally, our data indicate that observing P600-like brain responses provides no direct evidence for the presence of language-like grammars, in language or elsewhere.","2019-10-15","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2019-08-01 17:52:48","425-436","","","200","","NeuroImage","Finding the P3 in the P600","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/j2efc/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67","","","","","ERP; P3; Language; Domain specificity; Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); P600; Syntax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted initial field surveys across a spectrum of social movements, including Occupy Wall Street and #metoo, as well as those related to business sustainability and gun control, which showed that institutional insiders are often just as angry as outsider activists. But the evidence from those surveys did not show that social movement anger translated into collective action intentions among institutional insiders. We tested our theory deductively with an experiment conducted with participants who were supportive of social movement issues in their organizations. Overall, our results show that anger about a social movement issue relates to greater collective action intentions among outsider activists but not among institutional insiders. Instead of anger emboldening institutional insiders to act despite the potential costs, anger triggers fear about the potential negative consequences of collective action in the workplace, which in turn results in withdrawal. While social movements often rely on anger frames to mobilize sympathizers, our work suggests that this practice may paradoxically cause fear that immobilizes those uniquely positioned to be able to influence organizations to change.","2019-10-21","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-10-18 17:37:27","2020-03-03 19:39:28","0001839219879646","","","","","Administrative Science Quarterly","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","https://osf.io/jkect/","","","","","collective action; insider activism; social movements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we combined signal detection theory (SDT) with a false belief task. As application of SDT allows us to separate perceptual sensitivity from criteria, we are able to investigate how another person’s beliefs change the participant’s perception of near-threshold stimuli. Participants (n = 55) watched four different videos in which an actor saw (or did not see) a Gabor cube hidden (or not hidden) behind an occluder. At the end of each video, the occluder vanished revealing a cube either with or without Gabor pattern, and participants needed to report whether they saw the Gabor pattern or not. A pre-registered analysis with classical statistics weakly suggests an effect of the actor’s belief on participant’s perceptions. An exploratory Bayesian analysis supports the idea that when the actor believed the cube was present, participants made slower and more liberal judgements.

A role for visual attention in reward-based decisions has previously been demonstrated, but it remains unclear how visual attention is recruited during aversive learning, particularly when learning about multiple stimuli concurrently. This question is of particular importance in psychopathology, where enhanced attention to threat is a putative feature of pathological anxiety. Using an aversive reversal learning task that required subjects to learn, and exploit, predictions about multiple stimuli, we show that the allocation of visual attention is influenced significantly by aversive value but not by uncertainty. Moreover, this relationship is bidirectional in that attention biases value updates for attended stimuli, resulting in heightened value estimates.

In the present research, we examine the dispositional shift—that is, psychologically distant (vs. near) events are attributed to dispositional (vs. situational) causes. Using construal level theory, we hypothesize that the dispositional shift is caused by a change in stability (but not necessarily locus) of attribution. Two experiments support this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, distant (vs. near) future events were attributed to more stable causes. In Experiment 2, actions by a socially distant person (vs. oneself) were also attributed to more stable (but also more internal) causes. Thus, important psychological manipulations, here psychological distance, can influence causal dimensions selectively, supporting the independence of stability and locus of attribution.","2019-10-24","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-03-03 20:36:21","1948550619877856","","","","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","Dissecting Dispositionality","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/ksyzu","","","","","construal level theory; causal attribution; causal dimensions; psychological distance; stability of attribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a longitudinal study, we examined whether early social experiences and individual differences in temperament predict RS assessed subsequently. Results showed that positive early social experiences (ages 6 and 9 parents’ relationship quality and age 9 peer support) negatively predicted RS at age 12 and that negative affect (ages 6 and 9) positively predicted age-12 RS. These findings may have important implications for RS-reduction efforts and for understanding the many domain-specific manifestations of RS.","2019-10-24","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-03-03 20:38:38","1948550619878422","","","","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","Social-Experience and Temperamental Predictors of Rejection Sensitivity","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/6ecqu","","","","","temperament; negative affectivity; rejection sensitivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ‘silent epidemic’ is a major cause of death and disability in adolescents and young adults, with significant societal and economic impacts. Globally, the largest cause of neurotrauma is road traffic collisions (RTCs). Neurotrauma and RTCs are largely preventable, and many preventative strategies and interventions have been established and implemented over the last decades, particularly in high-income countries. However, these approaches may not be applicable globally, due to variations in environment, resources, population, culture and infrastructure. This paper outlines the protocol for a scoping review, which seeks to map the evidence on strategies and interventions in neurotrauma and RTCs prevention globally, and to ascertain contextual factors that influence their implementation. Methods and analysis This scoping review will use the established methodology by Arksey and O’Malley. Eligible studies will be identified from five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Global Health/EBSCO and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and grey literature sources. We will also carry out bibliographical and citation searching of included studies. A two-stage selection process, which involves screening of titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening, will be used to determine eligible studies which will undergo data abstraction using a customised, piloted data extraction sheet. The extracted data will be presented using evidence mapping and a narrative summary. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review, which is the first step in a multiphase public health research project on the global prevention of neurotrauma. The final review will be submitted for publication to a scientific journal, and results will be presented at appropriate conferences, workshops and meetings.

Here, we asked whether unidimensionality is necessary for the number line to promote fraction magnitude concepts and whether left-to-right orientation and labeled endpoints are sufficient. We randomly assigned second- and third-graders (N = 148) to one of four 15-min one-on-one, experimenter-led trainings. Three number line trainings had identical scripts, where the experimenter taught children to segment and shade the number line along the horizontal dimension. The number line conditions varied only in the vertical dimension of the training number line: pure unidimensional number line (17.5 cm horizontal line), hybrid unidimensional number line (17.5 × 0.6 cm rectangle), and square number line (17.5 × 17.5 cm). In the area model condition, children were taught to segment and shade a square (17.5 × 17.5 cm) along both dimensions. The conditions significantly differed in posttest fraction magnitude comparison accuracy (a transfer task), controlling for pretest accuracy, reading achievement, and age. In preregistered analyses, the hybrid unidimensional number line condition significantly outperformed the square area model condition and the square number line condition. In exploratory analyses accounting for training protocol fidelity, these results held and the pure unidimensional number line also outperformed the area model condition on fraction magnitude comparisons. We argue that unidimensionality is a critical feature of the number line for promoting fraction magnitude concepts because it aligns with a key concept—that real numbers, including fractions, can be ordered along a single dimension.","2019-11-01","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2019-10-14 17:38:10","104657","","","187","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/asgze","","","","","Area model; Fractions; Magnitude; Mathematical development; Number line; Numerical Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adopting a revisionist perspective, we assume that people manage self-control exertion efficiently and ask what psychological mechanism would counteract motivational withdrawal following initial exertion in order to sustain an important goal pursuit. We predicted and found that prior self-control increased students' motivation for active pursuit of the academic goal. In Study 1, prior self-control reduced students' behavioral intentions for school work and non-academic activities alike when academic pursuit was not activated. Under active pursuit of the academic goal, however, prior self-control uniquely increased students' intentions for school work. In Study 2, this facilitatory effect of prior self-control on behavioral intention toward an academic goal was replicated and accompanied by positive implicit attitudes toward study-related stimuli. In Study 3, when preparing to pursue the academic goal, prior self-control increased students' tendency to proactively remove a temptation from the immediate context (leave their phone with the experimenter) to support better task performance. Our investigation illustrates the importance of examining not only the debilitating but also the potentially facilitatory effect of prior self-control exertion.","2019-11-01","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2019-12-06 15:08:52","103875","","","85","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Protecting an important goal","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/x3prf","","","","","Motivation; Self-control; Self-regulation; Ego depletion; Goal pursuit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has not clearly dissociated the effects of information about perpetrators’ genetic endowment versus their environmental circumstances. Additionally, most research has focused exclusively on violations involving extreme physical harm, often using mock capital sentences cases as examples. To address these gaps in the literature, we employed a “switched-at-birth” paradigm to investigate whether positive or negative information about perpetrators’ genetic or environmental backgrounds influence evaluations of a perpetrator’s mental states, character, and deserved punishment. Across three studies, we varied whether the transgression involved direct harm, an impure act that caused no harm, or a case of moral luck. The results indicate that negative genetic and environmental backgrounds influenced participants’ evaluations of perpetrators’ intentions, free will, and character, but did not influence participants’ punishment decisions. Overall, these results replicate and extend existing findings suggesting that perpetrators’ supposed extenuating circumstances may not mitigate the punishment that others assign to them.","2019-10-22","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-03-03 19:51:46","e0224093","","10","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","https://osf.io/9rjta","","","","","Behavior; Surveys; Heart; Children; Language; Genetic predisposition; Charts; Criminal punishment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated positive associations between instructors’ identity leadership and exercisers’ group identification and comfort in the exercise environment four weeks later. Furthermore, results provided evidence of indirect effects. First, identity leadership was associated with members’ more frequent class attendance through their stronger group identification. Second, identity leadership was associated with members’ greater in-class effort through (a) their stronger group identification, and (b) their greater comfort. These relationships remained significant when accounting for the effect of established motivational predictors (i.e., competence and autonomy). These results point to the role that instructors’ leadership plays in promoting physical activity by suggesting that instructors’ engagement in identity leadership is associated with exercisers’ group-related experiences which, in turn, are a basis for group exercise participation.","2019-11-01","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2019-06-17 14:01:14","101544","","","45","","Psychology of Sport and Exercise","Putting the ‘we’ into workout","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/m9rt8/wiki/home/?view_only=44eb5759e02c4eea8f23b1a05b8884bd","","","","","Physical activity; Group identification; Social identity; Leadership; Group exercise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One proposed intervention strategy for reducing intake of these foods is to increase non-food reward experiences (e.g., music, socializing, art) in their place. However, research supporting this strategy has yet to establish temporal order between non-food reward experiences and highly processed food intake, and has yet to test mediators. The current study sought to build upon this literature with an ambulatory electronic diary study wherein the time-specific associations between non-food reward experiences and highly processed food intake were observed. A sample of 84 young adults reported on multiple types of non-food reward experiences and highly processed food intake hourly for two weekdays and two weekend days through an application on their personal electronic devices. Time-lagged analysis was employed to predict the odds of highly processed food intake in the following hour from non-food rewards experienced in the current hour. Secondary (e.g., receiving positive social feedback) and hedonic (e.g., viewing pleasant images) non-food reward experiences in the current hour predicted greater instead of lower odds of highly processed food intake in the following hour. These associations were mediated by increased subjective pleasure. Purely eudaimonic (e.g., affirming values), social (e.g., cooperating with others), and primary (e.g., having sex) reward experiences generally did not predict odds of highly processed food intake in the following hour. These results suggest that—at least for young adults—many non-food reward experiences may fail to reduce highly processed food intake, and some may even backfire. A different intervention strategy targeting reward processes implicated in highly processed food intake (e.g., interfering with conditioned learned associations) may prove a more promising avenue for improving physical health.","2019-11-01","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2020-10-18 17:37:26","2019-08-20 17:57:46","104355","","","142","","Appetite","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  Methods were preregistered on the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/cn85q/, with an amendment at https://osf.io/8j7p6/.","","","","","Reward; Pleasure; Behavior substitution; Highly processed food intake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both studies found that: at low RIGO, MS (vs. comparison condition) decreased satisfaction with life; however, at high RIGO, MS increased satisfaction with life. Study 2 further found that the moderating role of RIGO was not due to its association with self-esteem, but also failed to replicate prior evidence suggesting self-esteem moderates the effect of MS on satisfaction with life.

We asked if concerns for group reputation might determine how people respond to the moral indiscretions of group members. In four studies, participants read about an immoral act committed by a member of their political party. The act was either publicly known to people outside of the participant's political party (i.e., “public transgression”) or hidden from public view (i.e., “private transgression”). In the public transgression condition, participants endorsed having their political party openly denounce the transgressor in an apparent effort to prevent the party's reputation from being tarnished by association. In the private transgression condition, however, they were reluctant to publicly report the transgressive party member, presumably to prevent reputational loss. Feelings of responsibility for the group arising from either identity fusion with the party or being experimentally assigned to occupy a position of responsibility for the party amplified these effects. Strongly fused participants were even willing to contemplate extreme, unethical actions aimed at protecting party reputation (e.g. tampering with incriminating evidence), regardless of the publicness of the transgression. We conclude that feelings of responsibility for the group and reputational considerations determine whether people denounce or protect ingroup transgressors.","2019-11-01","2020-10-18 17:37:25","2020-10-18 17:37:25","2019-12-06 14:21:56","103874","","","85","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Tribalism can corrupt","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/eaj7f/?view_only=1cdb34ead54f480b88ef7ff60706441f","","","","","Group reputation; Group responsibility; Identity fusion; Ingroup moral transgressions; Moral reputation; Moral violations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dynamic learning rates were estimated to assess the relative importance ascribed to new information in response to volatility. Mixed-effects regression was used to analyze throw patterns as a function of social anxiety symptoms.

Consistent with prior work, participants self-reported more concentration difficulty and more mind wandering with no device present compared to using the phone. Resisting the phone led to greater perceived concentration abilities than sitting without the device (not having external stimulation). Failing to replicate prior work, however, participants without external stimulation did not rate the experience as less enjoyable or more boring than having something to do. We also observed that skin conductance data were consistent across conditions for the first three-minutes of the experiment, after which participants who resisted the phone were less aroused than those who were without the phone. We discuss how the findings contribute to our understanding of exercising self-control with mobile media and how psychological consequences, such as increased mind wandering and focusing challenges, relate to periods of idleness or free thinking.","2019-11-04","2020-10-18 17:37:24","2020-10-18 17:37:24","2020-03-05 20:54:42","e0224464","","11","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/38krr/","","","","","Attention; Questionnaires; Cognition; Anxiety; Happiness; Cell phones; Skin physiology; Social communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five studies (N = 1,993) investigated the relationships between fundamental social motives and PIL. In Study 1, attribution of a life goal pursuit to disease avoidance, affiliation, or kin care motives correlated with higher PIL. Studies 2 and 3 found correlations of self-protection, disease avoidance, affiliation, mate retention, and kin care motives with PIL after controlling for potential confounds. Study 4 showed that writing about success in the status, mating, and kin care domains increased PIL. Study 5 replicated the effect for mating and kin care, but not for status.

To assess the impact of this flexibility on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, the same dataset was independently analyzed by 70 teams, testing nine ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytic approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyze the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in hypothesis test results, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of their analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Importantly, meta-analytic approaches that aggregated information across teams yielded significant consensus in activated regions across teams. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset. Our findings show that analytic flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and demonstrate factors related to variability in fMRI. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.","2019-11-15","2020-10-18 17:37:23","2020-10-18 17:37:23","2019-11-19 20:13:41","","","","","","","","","","","","Neuroscience","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","00000  ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  DOI: 10.1101/843193","<p>Hosting of the data on OpenNeuro supported by NIH grant R24MH117179.</p>","","","NIH funding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present experiment examines the social transmission of health information, focusing on disorder etiology. Participants were placed in one of three generations of social transmission chains. The first generation read information concerning one of four fictitious disorders, pairing one disorder (Physiological or Psychological) with one etiology (Genetic or Environmental). Then, to ensure minimal loss of information (which is common in open-ended recollections), participants recalled key aspects of the disorders through multiple-choice questions. Their selections were used to modify the vignettes for the second generation and the third generation read the second’s recollections. All participants also evaluated diagnosed patients on social distance and disgust. Findings suggest that genetic etiology was better recalled when paired with a psychological disorder than a physiological one. Participants desired more social distance from psychological disorders’ patients (regardless of etiology) and showed higher disgust for environmental etiological patients (regardless of disorder).

Numerous factors contribute to the underuse of buprenorphine, and theory-informed approaches to identify and address implementation barriers and facilitators are needed. This scoping review aims to characterise the barriers and facilitators at the patient, healthcare professional, organisation and system level according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and identify gaps to inform practice and policy. Methods and analysis We will conduct a scoping review using established methods and follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. We will identify English and French-language peer-reviewed literature by searching five electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and SocINDEX), from inception and use Google, websites of key organisations, and two or more custom search engines to identify relevant grey literature. Eligible records will be quantitative or qualitative studies that examine barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine use at the patient, healthcare professional, organisation and system level, and involve participants with diagnosis of opioid use disorder or professionals involved in their care. Two reviewers will be involved in independently screening, reviewing and charting the data and calibration exercises will be conducted at each stage. We will conduct descriptive analysis for the charted data, and deductively code barriers and facilitators using the TDF. Ethics and dissemination As a scoping review of the literature, this study does not require ethics approval. Our dissemination strategy will focus on developing tailored activities to meet the needs of diverse knowledge user audiences. Barriers and facilitators mapped to the TDF can be linked to evidence-based strategies for change to improve buprenorphine use and access, and enable practice to reduce opioid-related harms.","2019-12-01","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-04-27 15:30:51","e032285","","12","9","","","Barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine use for opioid agonist treatment","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, OXT enhances activity of the brain reward system in both sexes. Importantly, a crucial and still open question is whether there are sex-specific dose-response relationships for the amygdala and striatal regions. To address this question, a total of 90 healthy women participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and the results were compared with our previous findings from men. Participants were randomly assigned to three doses of OXT (6 IU, 12 IU, and 24 IU) and completed an emotional face recognition task including fearful and happy faces of varying emotional intensities. Across doses, OXT enhanced amygdala reactivity to low fearful faces compared to placebo and increased responses to happy faces in the dorsal striatum in women. While treatment effects on amygdala reactivity were evident at each given dose, the OXT effect on striatal responses to social stimuli was more pronounced with higher doses, but this dose-dependent effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Importantly, OXT effects on amygdala and striatal activation significantly differed between sexes and striatal baseline sexual-dimorphic response patterns were diminished after administration of OXT. Our findings suggest that OXT increases the salience of social signals by strengthening the sensitivity for these signals in the amygdala and in the striatum in women, while OXT may primarily induce anxiolysis by reducing amygdala responses in men.","2019-11-30","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-03-20 14:34:25","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  https://osf.io/yxrsf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this protocol is to describe the methodological considerations that will guide the completion of a scoping review that will inventorise and assess the effectiveness of the various non-pharmacological interventions that are documented in literature for improving quality of life of people with dementia living in long-term care. Methods and analysis This scoping review will combine the methodology outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and Guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews by Peters et al. PubMed; MEDLINE; CINAHL; Embase; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Emcare; Sociological Abstracts and PsycINFO databases will be searched. Grey literature databases will also be explored. A two-stage screening process consisting of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review will be used to determine the eligibility of studies. Studies, irrespective of design, will be included that quantitatively assess quality of life of long-term care residents who receive non-pharmacological interventions for dementia. A pair of reviewers will independently assess all articles for eligibility, and all eligible articles will be abstracted and charted using a standardised form. The extracted data will undergo a ‘narrative review’ or a descriptive analysis of the contextual or process-oriented data and quantitative analysis reflecting the objectives of this scoping review.

The integration of wearable technology into the clinical pathway offers the ability to improve post-operative patient assessment beyond the scope of current, questionnaire-based patient-reported outcome measures. This scoping review assesses the current methodology and clinical application of accelerometers and inertial measurement units for the evaluation of patient activity and functional recovery following knee arthroplasty. Design This is a systematically conducted scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and reported consulting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. A protocol for this review is registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/rzg9q). Data sources CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched for manuscripts published between 2008 and 2019. Eligibility criteria We included clinical studies reporting the use of any combination of accelerometers, pedometers or inertial measurement units for patient assessment at any time point following knee arthroplasty. Data extraction and synthesis Data extracted from manuscripts included patient demographics, sensor technology, testing protocol and sensor-based outcome variables. Results 45 studies were identified, including 2076 knee arthroplasty patients, 620 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis and 449 healthy controls. Primary aims of the identified studies included functional assessment, physical activity monitoring and evaluation of knee instability. Methodology varied widely between studies, with inconsistency in reported sensor configuration, testing protocol and output variables. Conclusions The use of wearable sensors in evaluation of knee arthroplasty procedures is becoming increasingly common and offers the potential to improve clinical understanding of recovery and rehabilitation. While current studies lack consistency, significant opportunity exists for the development of standardised measures and protocols for function and physical activity evaluation.","2019-12-01","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-10-18 17:37:22","2020-05-15 13:16:35","e033832","","12","9","","","Current clinical utilisation of wearable motion sensors for the assessment of outcome following knee arthroplasty","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Moreover, we used advanced analyses—random-intercept cross-lag models—which address limitations of traditional cross-lag models. Results revealed health and well-being generally did not prospectively predict changes in one another across 1 year. In contrast, year-to-year changes in health were correlated with simultaneous changes in well-being—with effect sizes being largest for global well-being. These findings suggest that health and well-being change together in processes that unfold relatively quickly.

This suggests that pragmatic skills (such as understanding implied meanings in conversation) are separable from core language skills. However, it has been surprisingly difficult to demonstrate this dissociation in the general population. We propose that this may be because prior studies have used tasks in which different aspects of language are confounded.                                         Methods:               The present study used novel language tasks and factor analysis to test whether pragmatic language skills are separable from core language skills. 120 adult participants were recruited online to complete a 7-task battery, including a test assessing comprehension of conversational implicature.                                         Results:               In confirmatory analysis of a preregistered model, we compared whether the data showed better fit to a two-factor structure (including a pragmatic conversation comprehension and core language factor) or a simpler one-factor structure (comprising a general language factor). The two-factor model showed significantly better fit.                                         Conclusions:               This study supports the view that interpreting context-dependent conversational meaning is partially distinct from core language skill. This has implications for understanding the pragmatic language impairments reported in autism.","2019-04-15","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2019-04-22 18:35:19","68","","","4","","","""If you catch my drift...""","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","https://osf.io/g4bvm/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This convention ensures that perceptual impairment arising from developmental prosopagnosia can be distinguished from problems arising from a lack of visual experience with particular facial ethnicities – the so-called ‘Other-Ethnicity Effect’. The present study sought to determine whether the perceptual difficulties seen in developmental prosopagnosia – diagnosed using same-ethnicity faces – extend to other-ethnicity faces. First, we sought to determine whether a group of Caucasian developmental prosopagnosics (N = 15) and typical Caucasian controls (N = 30) had similar experience with same- and other-ethnicity faces during development. All participants therefore completed a contact questionnaire that enquired about their experience of Caucasian, Black, and East Asian faces, at different developmental stages. Importantly, the two groups described very similar levels of visual experience with other-ethnicity faces. Second, we administered a sequential matching task to measure participants’ ability to discriminate same- (Caucasian) and other-ethnicity (Black, East Asian) faces. Relative to the experience-matched controls, the prosopagnosics were less accurate at discriminating both same- and other-ethnicity faces, and we found no evidence of disproportionate impairment for same-ethnicity faces. Given that the prosopagnosics and controls had similar opportunity to develop visual expertise for other-ethnicity faces, these results indicate that developmental prosopagnosia impairs recognition of both same- and other-ethnicity faces. The fact that developmental prosopagnosia affects the perception of both same- and other-ethnicity faces suggests that different facial ethnicities engage similar visual processing mechanisms. Our findings support the view that susceptibility to developmental prosopagnosia, and a lack of contact with other-ethnicity faces, contribute independently to the poor recognition of other-ethnicity faces.","2019-04-15","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2019-04-22 18:39:21","","","","","","Cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/yck8s/","","","","","face recognition; Developmental prosopagnosia; other-ethnicity faces; visual experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simply providing numerical translations alongside reports or text containing verbal probabilities should encourage consistency, but these guidelines are often ignored. In an online experiment with 924 participants, we compared four different formats for presenting verbal probabilities with the numerical guidelines used in the US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 to see whether any could improve the correspondence between the intended meaning and participants’ interpretation (‘in-context’). This extends previous work in the domain of climate science. The four experimental conditions we tested were: 1. numerical guidelines bracketed in text, e.g. X is very unlikely (05–20%), 2. click to see the full guidelines table in a new window, 3. numerical guidelines appear in a mouse over tool tip, and 4. no guidelines provided (control). Results indicate that correspondence with the ICD 203 standard is substantially improved only when numerical guidelines are bracketed in text. For this condition, average correspondence was 66%, compared with 32% in the control. We also elicited ‘context-free’ numerical judgements from participants for each of the seven verbal probability expressions contained in ICD 203 (i.e., we asked participants what range of numbers they, personally, would assign to those expressions), and constructed ‘evidence-based lexicons’ based on two methods from similar research, ‘membership functions’ and ‘peak values’, that reflect our large sample’s intuitive translations of the terms. Better aligning the intended and assumed meaning of fuzzy words like ‘unlikely’ can reduce communication problems between the reporter and receiver of probabilistic information. In turn, this can improve decision making under uncertainty.","2019-04-17","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2020-10-18 17:37:51","2019-05-15 13:45:12","e0213522","","4","14","","PLOS ONE","Verbal probabilities","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/x9zav/","","","","","Intelligence; Social communication; Cognitive heuristics; Human intelligence; Lexicons; Numeracy; Peak values; Verbal communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critically, this signal conveys trustworthiness whether or not the target and the observer hold the same view on the issue. Five studies (N = 3,817) demonstrated the predicted effect of caring on integrity-based trust (Studies 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4)—even in cases of strong disagreement—across a variety of issues (Study 1) and when behavioral outcomes with real stakes were used (Studies 3a and 3b). This effect largely results from a perception of low-caring targets as particularly untrustworthy (Study 2). Additionally, participants trusted targets with staunchly opposing views about an issue even though they simultaneously disliked them (Study 4).

Recent research suggests that perceivers hold target-specific malleability beliefs that certain people, but not others, can change. Six experiments and an internal meta-analysis demonstrate that political orientation operates as a target-specific cue to malleability, with liberals judged as slightly more malleable than conservatives. We test whether target age, gender, and political ideological extremity account for the effect, and find that target ideological extremity independently predicts greater perceived fixedness. A final experiment finds that political prejudice influences malleability beliefs: political outgroup members are judged less favorably than political ingroup members and as a result, are judged to be more fixed. This research contributes to a growing body of work illustrating that some people are believed to be more malleable than others.","2019-05-01","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2019-02-28 18:36:24","141-151","","","82","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Malleable liberals and fixed conservatives?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/nfajt/","","","","","Prejudice; Lay theories; Malleability; Political orientation; Target-specificity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although similar processes might be involved in auditory awareness, only sparse evidence exists for this idea. In the present study, we recorded electrophysiological activity while subjects listened to tones that were presented at their own awareness threshold. The difference in electrophysiological activity elicited by tones that subjects reported being aware of versus unaware of showed an early negativity about 200 ms and a late positivity about 300 ms after stimulus onset. These results closely match those found in vision and provide convincing evidence for an early negativity (auditory awareness negativity: AAN), as well as an LP. These findings suggest that theories of visual awareness are also applicable to auditory awareness.","2019-05-01","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2019-04-16 18:12:00","70-78","","","71","","Consciousness and Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","group A, doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/HN8KJ; group B, doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/SHVZD","","","","","Awareness; Electroencephalography; Consciousness; Auditory; Auditory awareness negativity; Late positivity; Threshold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present data from a pilot test with participants (n = 125) after experiencing a ride in an electric AV on a large clinic area in Berlin, Germany. As a first contribution, we bridge the gap between missing definitions of key constructs, confusion about their operationalisations, and a rigorous test of their statistical properties and data structure by examining scales on acceptance, trust, perceived safety, intention to use, and—for the first time applied to AVs—the emotions amusement, fear, surprise, and boredom. Tests of reliability and normality were satisfying for almost all constructs (Cronbach’s alphas ≥ .69; six of eight scales normally distributed). The vehicles were accepted (M = 1.22; SD = 0.70; range -2 to 2), trusted (M = 3.29; SD = 0.81; range 1 to 5), and perceived as safe (M = 3.29; SD = 1.03; range 1 to 5). However, factor analyses did not reflect the hypothesised data structure, and validity concerns question the suitability of some constructs for attitude assessment of electric AVs. Our open item for comments added valuable insights in qualitative aspects of user attitudes towards electric AVs regarding driving style, technical features, and (unsettling) audio-visual feedback. We thus argue for broader conceptualisations of key constructs based on interdisciplinary exchange and multi-methodical study designs.","2019-05-02","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2019-05-22 13:45:25","e0215969","","5","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/92pv5","","","","","Emotions; Research validity; Statistical data; Fear; Normal distribution; Automation; Eigenvalues; Factor analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies suggest that motivation and engagement can influence the effectiveness of cognitive training. As such, we developed a gamified cognitive control training procedure. Before validating this tool in a clinical sample, a convenience sample was used to ensure that gamification did not add any unwanted side effects to the cognitive training procedure. This study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/5yacs). Following a baseline assessment, participants were assigned to one of four training conditions, manipulating training task (cognitive control vs. active control) and gamification level (low vs. high). Having performed 10 sessions, participants were invited for a post-training assessment. The impact of gamification on cognitive transfer, motivation, and emotional transfer was investigated. Our results suggest task-specific cognitive transfer. In line with our hypotheses, gamification level did not affect cognitive transfer while beneficially impacting motivation. Moreover, beneficial effects of gamified cognitive control training were found for self-reported anxiety levels, in the absence of effects on the other clinical outcomes. This study showed that the newly developed gamified cognitive control training procedure yields similar effects as non-gamified cognitive control training. However, the advantage of this newly developed version is that it is more user-friendly, easy-to-use, online, and that its settings maximize user motivation and engagement, potentially enabling a more effective training.","2019-04-29","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2019-05-06 19:21:15","","","","","","J Cogn Enhanc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000","","","","","Motivation; Depression; Relapse prevention; Cognitive control training; Gamification; Internet intervention; Transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Annual measures of smoking included status and intensity. Frequency of pub attendance was assessed biennially between 1996 and 2008. In 2010 and 2013, more precise measures of alcohol consumption were available. We conducted two-level regression analyses for the outcomes measured more than twice and residual change analyses for other outcomes. Over time (within persons), there were no significant effects on smoking. Activity in voluntary organizations predicted slightly less frequent pub attendance in younger adults. In residual change analyses, activity in voluntary organizations decreased last-week ethanol consumption and risk of heavy episodic drinking in younger women. These effects pertained mainly to service-orientated organizations. In middle-aged adults, membership and attendance at meetings of voluntary organizations predicted slightly more frequent pub attendance. Residual change analyses showed volunteering to reduce the risk of heavy episodic drinking in middle-aged men. In older adults, few significant effects emerged. Between persons, all indicators of participation were associated with less smoking, whereas membership was associated with more and activity with less frequent pub attendance. Thus, most associations between participation in voluntary organizations and substance use reflected interindividual differences.","2019-04-29","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2020-10-18 17:37:50","2019-05-06 19:13:32","100885","","","","","Preventive Medicine Reports","Does participation in voluntary organizations protect against risky alcohol and tobacco use?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/guzem","","","","","Smoking; Alcohol drinking; Age groups; Community participation; Political activism; Social participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this prior research examined performance on nonspatial, nondynamic tasks. In three experiments, we pitted four hypotheses against each other, to test skill acquisition for intercepting repeated trajectories in a spatial and dynamic task: the item-specific algorithmic speedup hypothesis, the item-specific retrieval shift hypothesis, the collective retrieval shift hypothesis, and the combined hypothesis (item-specific algorithmic speedup followed by a collective retrieval shift). We found evidence for the combined hypothesis. Specifically, under easy conditions, we found small improvements on repeated trajectories that were attributable to item-specific algorithmic speedup. By contrast, under difficult conditions, we found strong evidence that the performance benefits for repeated trajectories were driven primarily by a collective shift from algorithmic to direct-retrieval strategies. This evidence for collective retrieval shift is in direct contrast to theories suggesting item-specific retrieval shifts.

In addition, we investigated whether parenting stress and social support were prospectively associated with later sCRP and changes in sCRP from 12 to 18 months of age, as well as whether those changes in sCRP were associated with subsequent infant salivary telomere length (sTL), a marker of biological aging. Analyses revealed that while there were no cross-sectional associations between maternal factors and infant sCRP, maternal parenting stress and social support when infants were 12 months of age predicted infant sCRP at 18 months of age. Further, maternal social support predicted changes in infant sCRP from 12 to 18 months of age. We observed a null association between infant sCRP and sTL.

Distrust toward politicians seems to matter much more than general attitudes on income inequality when citizens form opinions on politicians’ pay. Furthermore, citizens’ aversion to high pay for politicians is affected by institutional delegation, but such delegation only lessen the opposition to pay raises modestly, leaving most citizens firmly against pay raises for politicians.

In Experiment 1 (N = 201), with payback percentage presented in a numerical format, participants displayed a non-optimal preference for cards with greater numbers of unclaimed prizes and lower payback percentages.

It has been conjectured that withholding during urge involves active response suppression. We tested that idea by designing an urge paradigm that required participants to resist an impulse to press a button and gain relief from heat (one hand was poised to press while the other arm had heat stimulation). We first used paired-pulse TMS over motor cortex to measure corticospinal excitability of the hand that could press for relief, while participants withheld movement. We observed increased short-interval intracortical inhibition, an index of M1 GABAergic interneuron activity that was maintained across seconds and specific to the task-relevant finger. A second experiment replicated this. We next used EEG to better “image” putative cortical signatures of motor suppression and pain. We found increased sensorimotor beta contralateral to the task-relevant hand while participants withheld the movement during heat. We interpret this as further evidence of a motor suppressive process. Additionally, there was beta desynchronization contralateral to the arm with heat, which could reflect a pain signature. Strikingly, participants who “suppressed” more exhibited less of a putative “pain” response. We speculate that, during urge, a suppressive state may have functional relevance for both resisting a prohibited action and for mitigating discomfort.","2019-05-06","2020-10-18 17:37:49","2020-10-18 17:37:49","2019-05-30 13:27:38","1-18","","","","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/85axu/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Events that are relevant to one’s social group, and furthermore, are congruent with the prior beliefs of that group, should be more likely to be retained as flashbulb memories. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was relevant to ongoing political conversations in both Germany and the Netherlands, but, while the disaster was congruent with German beliefs about the dangers of nuclear energy, it was incongruent with Dutch support for nuclear power. Danish participants would not have found the disaster to be particularly relevant. Partially consistent with this prediction, across two samples (N = 265 and N = 518), German participants were most likely to have flashbulb memories for the Fukushima disaster. Furthermore, event features thought to be related to flashbulb memory formation (e.g. ratings of importance and consequentiality) also differed as a function of nationality.

Growth curve analyses indicated that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were uniquely related to depressive symptoms. Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms over time. Additionally, changes in attachment security were associated with changes in depressive symptoms.

Design A pre-registered (https://osf.io/qept5/), randomized, within-subject design experiment. Methods 28 trained and experienced male cyclists completed a 20 min self-paced cycling time-trial exercise in two separate sessions, corresponding to two working memory load conditions: 1-back or 2-back. We measured power output, heart rate, RPE and mental fatigue. Results Bayes analyses revealed extreme evidence for the 2-back task being more demanding than the 1-back task, both in terms of accuracy (BF10 = 4490) and reaction time (BF = 1316). The data only showed anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis for the power output (BF10 = 1.52), moderate evidence for the null hypothesis for the heart rate (BF10 = 0.172), anecdotal evidence for RPE (BF10 = 0.72) and anecdotal evidence for mental fatigue (BF10 = 0.588). Conclusions Our data seem to challenge the idea that self-paced exercise is regulated by top-down processing, given that we did not show clear evidence of exercise impairment (at the physical, physiological and subjective levels) in the high cognitive load condition task with respect to the low working memory load condition. The involvement of top-down processing in self-pacing the physical effort, however, cannot be totally discarded. Factors like the duration of the physical and cognitive tasks, the potential influence of dual-tasking, and the participants’ level of expertise, should be taken into account in future attempts to investigate the role of top-down processing in self-paced exercise.","2019-05-31","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2019-06-25 19:08:49","e0217825","","5","14","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","https://osf.io/zg32h","","","","","Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Heart rate; Exercise; Fatigue; Walking; Reaction time; Cognitive impairment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By assessing how people think, feel, and behave when it comes to eating or not eating animal products, Rosenfeld and Burrow (2018) Dietarian Identity Questionnaire (DIQ) can serve a valuable role in advancing quantitative research on vegetarian identity. First, however, it is important to ensure that the DIQ exhibits psychometrically sound properties among vegetarians, as Rosenfeld and Burrow (2018) validated the factor structure of the DIQ in samples comprised predominantly of meat-eaters. In the current research, I validated the DIQ’s factor structure in a large sample of vegetarians (N = 992) by evaluating its items’ factor loadings, model fit (including CFI, RMSEA, and SRMR), and subscales’ internal consistencies.

In a preregistered study, 30 pairs of naïve participants played an augmented-reality game involving moving blocks in space. We compared imitation fidelity between trials where the leader watched the followers’ action, and trials where the leader did not watch. Followers imitated the trajectory height demonstrated by the leader, and critically, the strength of this correlation was greater in trials where the follower knew the leader was watching them. This suggests that followers spontaneously used imitation as a social signal in a nonverbal interaction task, supporting socio-communicative hypotheses of imitation.","2019-06-01","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2019-03-21 17:01:15","150-155","","","187","","Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/ezj8g/","","","","","Imitation; Audience effect; Dyadic interaction; Social signalling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas some researchers believe that this so-called continued influence effect of misinformation (CIEM) simply arises from the insufficient encoding and integration of corrective claims, others assume that it arises from a competition between the correct information and the initial misinformation in memory. To examine these possibilities, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In each study, participants were asked to (a) read a series of brief news reports that contained confirmations or corrections of prior information and (b) evaluate whether subsequently presented memory probes matched the reports' correct facts rather than the initial misinformation. Both studies revealed that following correction-containing news reports, participants struggled to refute mismatching memory probes, especially when they referred to initial misinformation (as opposed to mismatching probes with novel information). We found little evidence, however, that the encoding of confirmations and corrections produced systematic neural processing differences indicative of distinct encoding strategies. Instead, we discovered that following corrections, participants exhibited increased activity in the left angular gyrus and the bilateral precuneus in response to mismatching memory probes that contained prior misinformation, compared to novel mismatch probes. These findings favour the notion that people's susceptibility to the CIEM arises from the concurrent retention of both correct and incorrect information in memory.","2019-06-01","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2019-03-21 17:03:30","46-56","","","193","","NeuroImage","Keeping track of ‘alternative facts’","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/y557s/registrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to clarify whether a tDCS montage with one electrode over a fronto-medial stimulation site and the return electrode on the chin can indeed modulate working memory performance. It was predicted that tDCS with the anode over the fronto-medial site should lead to better working memory performance compared to when the cathode is placed over the fronto-medial site. Eighty-four participants were divided into three groups receiving either 10-min sham, anodal, or cathodal stimulation at 2 mA offline between two blocks of a two-back task. No significant differences between stimulation conditions were found. Bayes statistics indicated moderate evidence that the null hypothesis is in fact true. This paper demonstrates that the fronto-medial tDCS montage has no functional impact on working memory performance. Future studies could investigate fronto-medial frequency-specific oscillatory electric stimulation in the theta frequency range. Such oscillatory electrical stimulation might be more successful than tDCS in modulating working memory processes.","2019-05-28","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2019-06-17 13:55:03","","","","","","J Cogn Enhanc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000  https://osf.io/fv8qx/?view_only=4549bf6a42ab4784a2180a24e8478405","","","","","Medial prefrontal cortex; Frontal-midline theta; Negative findings; Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such “A/B tests” are often criticized on ethical grounds even as similar, untested interventions are implemented without objection. We find robust evidence across 16 studies of 5,873 participants from three diverse populations spanning nine domains—from healthcare to autonomous vehicle design to poverty reduction—that people frequently rate A/B tests designed to establish the comparative effectiveness of two policies or treatments as inappropriate even when universally implementing either A or B, untested, is seen as appropriate. This “A/B effect” is as strong among those with higher educational attainment and science literacy and among relevant professionals. It persists even when there is no reason to prefer A to B and even when recipients are treated unequally and randomly in all conditions (A, B, and A/B). Several remaining explanations for the effect—a belief that consent is required to impose a policy on half of a population but not on the entire population; an aversion to controlled but not to uncontrolled experiments; and a proxy form of the illusion of knowledge (according to which randomized evaluations are unnecessary because experts already do or should know “what works”)—appear to contribute to the effect, but none dominates or fully accounts for it. We conclude that rigorously evaluating policies or treatments via pragmatic randomized trials may provoke greater objection than simply implementing those same policies or treatments untested.","2019-05-28","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2020-10-18 17:37:48","2019-06-07 14:24:59","10723-10728","","22","116","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Children (N = 172) aged 7–12 years participated in the training, which consisted of eight creativity exercises performed in a training session of two hours. The effectiveness of the training on stimulating children’s creative thinking skills was assessed by means of a pretest and posttest comparison using three creativity tasks (Alternative Uses Task, drawing task and guessing task). For each task several measures of creative performance were examined (e.g., fluency, flexibility, infrequency, elaboration).

Across three studies, we found that parenthood mediated age-related increases in social conservatism. Study 1 found that an experimental child interaction prime increased social conservatism in parents but not in nonparents. Study 2 (preregistered, n = 803) found a main effect of the prime, while Study 3 (preregistered, n = 763) found no experimental effect.

Many studies of this inpatient to outpatient transition use the rate of postdischarge readmissions as a patient-level outcome measure to assess the quality of transition. However, it is unclear how studies define the measure, and whether there is a shared understanding by the field regarding which definition is appropriate for which circumstances. This scoping review thus aims to examine how published studies have approached measuring unnecessary psychiatric readmissions. Methods and analysis The scoping review will be structured according to Levac et al’s enhancement to Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for conducting scoping reviews. The protocol is registered through the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5nxuc/). We will search literature databases for studies that (1) are about care transition processes associated with unnecessary psychiatric readmissions and (2) specify use of at least one readmission time interval (ie, time period since previous discharge from inpatient care, within which a hospitalisation can be considered a readmission). Screening and review of articles will be carried out by two reviewers, first independently then involving a third reviewer as needed for consensus. We will assess review findings through both tabular and thematic analyses, noting prevalent trends in study characteristics and emergent themes across our reviewed studies. Ethics and dissemination This work comes at a time of heightened interest by many mental healthcare systems in high-quality practices that structure their care processes towards effective inpatient to outpatient transitions. Findings will support the systems’ careful examination of alternative potential transitional interventions, helping to ensure that their often limited quality enhancement resources are put to optimal use. We will focus on disseminating our findings to the healthcare community through strong communication infrastructures and connections with health system stakeholders that our multidisciplinary study consultants will foster throughout this study.","2019-07-01","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2019-10-02 14:58:04","e030696","","7","9","","","Measurement of unnecessary psychiatric readmissions","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, little is known about the influence of varying stimulation parameters, such as polarity and intensity, on mind wandering, or even more broadly on executive function performance. Here, in a pre-registered design (n = 150), we investigated the effect of stimulation polarity and intensity on mind wandering while subjects undertook a repetitive cognitive task (sustained attention to response task, SART). We found a linear effect of stimulation dosage on the propensity to have task unrelated thoughts. Specifically, greater intensity cathodal tDCS resulted in increased mind wandering with anodal and cathodal stimulation showed the same pattern of results. These findings confirm a key role for the left prefrontal cortex in mind wandering, and, of import, demonstrate that increased dosage could lead to larger effects on mind wandering behaviours. This is in contrast to some previous reports suggesting that stimulation dosage presents a U-shaped function, highlighting the potential for optimal dosages to vary depending upon the targeted brain region and behaviour.","2019-06-01","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2019-06-04 16:53:16","379-384","","","129","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/zgyem","","","","","Prefrontal cortex; Brain stimulation; Mind wandering; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be partly explained by a generation effect: The act of generating a word is known to lead to a memory advantage (Slamecka & Graf, 1978). In earlier work, we showed a generation effect for recognition of images (Zormpa, Brehm, Hoedemaker, & Meyer, 2019). Here, we tested whether the recognition of their names would also benefit from name generation. Testing whether picture naming improves memory for words was our primary aim, as it serves to clarify whether the representations affected by generation are visual or conceptual/lexical. A secondary aim was to assess the influence of processing time on memory. Fifty-one participants named pictures in three conditions: after hearing the picture name (identity condition), backward speech, or an unrelated word. A day later, recognition memory was tested in a yes/no task. Memory in the backward speech and unrelated conditions, which required generation, was superior to memory in the identity condition, which did not require generation. The time taken by participants for naming was a good predictor of memory, such that words that took longer to be retrieved were remembered better. Importantly, that was the case only when generation was required: In the no-generation (identity) condition, processing time was not related to recognition memory performance. This work has shown that generation affects conceptual/lexical representations, making an important contribution to the understanding of the relationship between memory and language.","2019-06-13","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2020-10-18 17:37:47","2019-07-19 15:52:36","","","","","","Psychon Bull Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000  https://osf.io/sqad9","","","","","Long-term memory; Generation effect; Processing time; Word production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our study was to clarify whether spatial configurations can be reorganized to a subset of objects during maintenance. Participants were shown an array of objects, and afterwards the objects disappeared. A valid cue was shown either during encoding or maintenance to highlight the side of the following probed object. Afterwards, the objects reappeared and participants were instructed to detect whether or not a particular object changed its location. We manipulated the configurations at retrieval regarding the number of objects, ranging from all objects to a single object. Our first and second experiment investigated reorganization for a number of six and 12 objects, respectively. In the third experiment, we used a retro cue only and manipulated eye movements (free view vs. enforced fixation).

Results from four studies (total N = 754) document a tendency to more strongly support the inclusion of women in male-dominated careers, compared to the inclusion of men in female-dominated careers. This asymmetry in support for social action towards change is predicted by beliefs about what the ideal gender representation should be and the perceived causes of gender imbalances in each career type.

In our first experiment using four stimulators (two on each side of the hand), we found novel evidence for a hand-centered Simon effect, along with the typical somatotopic Simon effect. Next, we examined whether the potential salience of these somatotopic codes could be reduced, by testing only one hand with two stimulators attached. In Experiments 2–4, we found a strong hand-centered Simon effect with a diminished somatotopic Simon effect, providing evidence that stimulus salience can change the weighting of somatosensory stimulus coding. Finally, we also found novel evidence that the hand-centered Simon effect is coded in external, not somatotopic, coordinates.

In a first study, we explored the unique relations between these constructs using state-of-the-art network analysis. Subsequently, we conducted a preregistered replication study.

Negotiators who thought about their counterpart’s choices (rather than constraints) were more willing to persist (Study 2), and this relationship was mediated by greater perceived negotiation room (Studies 3 and 4).

Participants were paid more for reporting higher digits, and were not penalized for making mistakes, thus providing an incentive to cheat. Results showed that participants frequently made self-serving (and rarely self-hurting) mistakes by reporting the Second-Cued Digit when it was more valuable than the target. Importantly, they rapidly gazed at the digit that they would later report, regardless of whether this report was correct or a self-serving mistake.

Yet, perhaps due to its complexity, surprisingly little is known about the neural basis of this fundamental ability. Here, we examined EEG waveforms evoked by different types of relations, conveyed by pairs of images. Subjects were presented with the pairs, that were either associatively related, abstractly related or unrelated, and judged if they were related or not. Evidence for a gradual modulation of the amplitude of the N400 and late negativity was found, such that unrelated pairs elicited the most negative amplitude, followed by abstractly-related pairs and lastly associatively-related ones. However, this was confined to first encounter with the pairs, and a different, more dichotomous pattern was observed when the pairs were viewed for the second time. Then, no difference was found between associatively and abstractly related pairs, while both differed from unrelated pairs. Notably, when the pairs were sequentially presented, this pattern was found mostly in right electrodes, while it appeared both in left and right sites during simultaneous presentation of the pairs. This suggests that while two different mechanisms may be involved in generating predictions about an upcoming related/unrelated stimulus, online processing of associative and abstract semantic relations might be mediated by a single mechanism. Our results further support claims that the N400 component indexes multiple cognitive processes that overlap in time, yet not necessarily in neural generators.","2019-07-04","2020-10-18 17:37:41","2020-10-18 17:37:41","2019-08-20 17:35:07","107127","","","","","Neuropsychologia","Understanding associative vs. abstract pictorial relations","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/rnpae/?view_only=6c664c3514a34ce294c3deb1cc76753a","","","","","Expectations mechanisms; Late negativity; N400; Object processing; Relational processing; Semantic integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined this question across three studies by manipulating category salience in an implicit stereotyping measure and by applying a process model that provides independent estimates of stereotype activation and application. Our results replicated past findings that category salience increases stereotyping.

The ART comprises seven theoretically motivated, empirically supported, interrelated aspects of recollecting autobiographical memories: reliving, vividness, visual imagery, scene, narrative coherence, life-story relevance, and rehearsal. Desirable psychometric properties of the ART are established by confirmatory factor analyses demonstrating that items probing each of the seven components form well-defined, yet highly correlated, factors that are indicators of a single underlying second-order factor. The ART shows high test-retest reliability over delays averaging three weeks and correlates meaningfully with a test of different categories of memory. Overall, the findings document that autobiographical recollection is a dimension that varies among individuals. The ART forms a reliable and easily administered autobiographical memory test that will help to integrate autobiographical memory research with fields generally concerned with individual differences, such as health and personality psychology.","2019-07-26","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2019-08-29 13:46:15","","","","","","Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","The Autobiographical Recollection Test (ART)","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/zvr7j/registrations","","","","","Imagery; Autobiographical memory; Individual differences test; Narrative; Recollective experience; Reliving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E-cigarettes may help quitters to control their weight through continued exposure to the appetite-suppressant effects of nicotine and behavioural aspects of vaping. This study explored the views and practices of smokers, ex-smokers and current e-cigarette users relating to vaping and weight control. Methods Cross-sectional survey of past-year smokers (n = 1320), current smokers (n = 1240) and current e-cigarette users (n = 394) in England, conducted April–July 2018. Data were weighted to match the English population on key sociodemographic characteristics. Results Of e-cigarette users, 4.6% (95%CI 2.6–6.6) reported vaping for weight control, and 1.9% (95%CI 0.6–3.2) reported vaping to replace meals/snacks. It was rare for individuals who had smoked in the past year to have heard (8.8%, 95%CI 7.3–10.3) or believe (6.4%, 95%CI 5.1–7.7) that vaping could help control weight. Women (OR = 0.62, 95%CI 0.42–0.93) and older people (OR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.13–0.72) were less likely to have heard the claim and women were less likely to believe it (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.27–0.72). However, 13.4% (95%CI 11.3–15.5) and 13.1% (95%CI 11.0–15.2) of current smokers who did not use e-cigarettes said they would be more likely to try e-cigarettes or quit smoking, respectively, if vaping could help control their weight. Conclusion One in 16 English people who have smoked in the last year believe that vaping would prevent weight gain after stopping. One in 22 people who vape are using e-cigarettes for this purpose. However, should evidence emerge that e-cigarettes prevent weight gain, one in eight people who smoke would be tempted to quit smoking and use e-cigarettes.","2019-08-01","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2019-04-15 19:59:06","211-219","","","95","","Addictive Behaviors","Vaping for weight control","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/2rmwb/","","","","","E-cigarettes; Vaping; Population survey; Weight control; Weight loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adverse effects of this phenomenon are widely recognized, but its psychological antecedents remain the focus of ongoing debate in political psychology. Past research has honed in on two conflicting explanations: one highlights the extent to which people self-define as supporters of particular parties or candidates (the identity view), and another points toward the intensity with which they disagree on substantive matters of policy (the issues view). A nationally representative survey of 1051 eligible Spanish voters yielded support for both explanations. The perceived magnitude and nature of disagreement were associated with increased partisan prejudice, while controlling for partisan identification. Path analyses revealed that issue-based prejudice was more pronounced among ideologically extreme agents (β = 0.237, 95% CI [0.174, 0.300]) than toward extreme targets (β = 0.140, 95% CI [0.078, 0.201]), and replicated recent findings that identity-based prejudice is motivated primarily by non-instrumental factors (β = 0.286, 95% CI [0.230, 0.337]). Together, these results indicate that discrimination across party lines responds to two fundamentally distinct, though at times co-occurring, imperatives: to coalesce in ideologically homogeneous communities, and to protect one’s sense of partisan identity.","2019-07-16","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2020-10-18 17:37:40","2019-08-27 15:42:33","e0219509","","7","14","","PLOS ONE","The dual nature of partisan prejudice","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/kj6ep/","","","","","United States; Surveys; Spain; Moral philosophy; Political parties; Racial discrimination; Social discrimination; Spanish people","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Psychophysiology research may be susceptible to selective reporting, given the high number of decision points and methodological complexity in analyses of psychophysiology data. We aimed to assess the presence of selective reporting and evidential value (i.e., that significant results are due to true underlying effects) in recent and past psychophysiological research by utilizing p-curve analyses. Study protocols and methods were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF). P-values and the associated test statistics were extracted from articles in the most recent issue (as of January 2018) and 10-year previous counterpart issue of three major psychophysiology journals: Psychophysiology, International Journal of Psychophysiology, and Journal of Psychophysiology. Using the p-curve application, 10 primary p-curves were conducted: all recent articles, all past articles, recent articles split by journal, past articles split by journal, recent cognitive electrophysiology articles, and past cognitive electrophysiology articles. Evidential value and generally adequate average power (≥78% average power) were present in all p-curves, except those that only included articles from the Journal of Psychophysiology because of the small number of articles published in the journal. Findings provide some positive news and indicate that, generally, results were not selectively reported, and selective reporting may not be a primary issue for this sample of psychophysiological research. Future p-curve analyses examining sub-disciplines of psychophysiology are recommended.","2019-08-01","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2019-06-28 15:58:54","33-49","","","142","","International Journal of Psychophysiology","Quantifying evidential value and selective reporting in recent and 10-year past psychophysiological literature","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00001  https://osf.io/tvw9h","","","","","Psychophysiology; -curve; Evidential value; Selective reporting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the social functions of emotion have attracted increased attention, the effects of positive emotions such as pride on impression formation remain poorly understood. Drawing on social projection theory, this study examined how incidental experiences of pride influenced the impressions of those who made a blunder, along with two other characteristics: the person’s warmth and competence. Participants were designated randomly to receive inductions of pride, awe, or a neutral emotion. Subsequently, they were asked to indicate their own impression of a person who had made a blunder and to rate their overall sense of that individual’s warmth and competence. A laboratory experiment recruiting university students (Study 1, N = 79) demonstrated that pride, a positive emotion elicited by a self-relevant achievement, led to higher competency evaluations of others. However, a pre-registered online experiment in middle-aged adults (Study 2, N = 108) failed to replicate the effects of pride on competency evaluations of others. Furthermore, another pre-registered online experiment in younger adults (Study 3, N = 290) did not show successful manipulation of incidental emotions. These results suggest that strictly controlled experimental settings that induce robust incidental emotions might be better for demonstrating a strong pride effect on the evaluation of others.","2019-08-08","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2019-12-06 14:27:43","e0220883","","8","14","","PLOS ONE","Does incidental pride increase competency evaluation of others who appear careless?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/bq5uj","","","","","Intelligence; Behavior; Emotions; Decision making; Fear; Happiness; Analysis of variance; Replication studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, we must use other cues to evaluate information—perhaps the most salient of which is consensus. But what counts as consensus? Do we attend only to surface-level indications of consensus, or do we also probe deeper and consider why sources agree? Four experiments demonstrated that individuals evaluate consensus only superficially: Participants were equally confident in conclusions drawn from a true consensus (derived from independent primary sources) and a false consensus (derived from only one primary source). This phenomenon was robust, occurring even immediately after participants explicitly stated that a true consensus was more believable than a false consensus.

Results showed that family functioning was not significantly associated with internalizing or externalizing problems, on the within-family level. Also, alternative standard Cross-Lagged Panel Models (CLPM) were applied; such models have been recently criticized for failing to explicitly disentangle between-family variance from within-family variance, but they have been the standard approach to investigating questions of temporal ordering.

In this study, we aimed to determine the magnitude of this relation, to feed into the discussion regarding whether amount of digital screen time has a subjectively significant impact on the psychosocial functioning of children and adolescents. Method We analyzed data from primary caregivers participating in the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), an annual nationally representative survey fielded by the US Census Bureau between June 2016 and February 2017. NSCH uses an address-based sampling frame and both Web- and paper-based data collection instruments to measure psychosocial functioning and digital engagement, including a modified version of the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire and caregiver estimates of daily television- and device-based engagement, respectively. Results The expected parabolic inverted-U-shaped relationship linking digital screen engagement to psychosocial functioning was found. These results replicated past findings suggesting that moderate levels of screen time (1−2 hours a day) were associated with slightly higher levels of psychosocial functioning compared to lower or higher levels of engagement. Furthermore, it indicated that children and adolescents would require 4 hours 40 minutes of television-based engagement and 5 hours 8 minutes of daily device-based engagement before caregivers would be able to notice subjectively significant variations in psychosocial functioning. Conclusion The possible influence of digital screen engagement is likely smaller and more nuanced than we might expect. These findings do not rule out the possibility that parents might only notice very high levels of screen time when their child manifests pronounced psychosocial difficulties. Future work should be guided by transparent and confirmatory programs of research.","2019-08-07","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2020-10-18 17:37:39","2019-12-06 14:23:41","","","","","","Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","How Much Is Too Much?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/w4r78/?view_only=afb49aea6dcd4c009a30c7f6e879856e","","","","","digital devices; digital screen time; psychosocial functioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying mechanism of this so-called in–out effect is far from settled. Contrary to the original explanation proposing an oral approach-avoidance mechanism, recent evidence has been used to support an oral motor-fluency mechanism, suggesting that inward words are preferred because they may be more common and/or easier to pronounce. Across six experiments (n = 1123), we examined the impact of different fluency sources in the emergence of the in–out effect. The preference for inward-wandering words persisted both with classical font type and figure-ground contrast fluency manipulations, and no systematic additive effects were observed. The in–out effect was also replicated for the first time with a between-participant design.

Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, exposure to nonverbal bias in favor of one individual over another led participants to develop nonverbal signal-consistent explicit biases.

We therefore assessed the association of REM intrusion and near-death experiences with different methods. Methods Using a crowd-sourcing platform, we recruited 1,034 lay people from 35 countries to investigate the prevalence of near-death experiences and self-reported REM sleep intrusion. Reports were validated using the Greyson Near-Death Experiences Scale (GNDES) with ≥7 points as cut-off for near-death experiences. Results Near-death experiences were reported by 106 of 1,034 participants (10%; 95% CI [8.5–12%]).

Previous searches for the specific genes involved have been underpowered and thus unable to detect genetic signals. Ganna et al. perform a genome-wide association study on 493,001 participants from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden to study genes associated with sexual orientation (see the Perspective by Mills). They find multiple loci implicated in same-sex sexual behavior indicating that, like other behavioral traits, nonheterosexual behavior is polygenic. Science, this issue p. eaat7693; see also p. 869 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONAcross human societies and in both sexes, some 2 to 10% of individuals report engaging in sex with same-sex partners, either exclusively or in addition to sex with opposite-sex partners. Twin and family studies have shown that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetically influenced, but previous searches for the specific genes involved have been underpowered to detect effect sizes realistic for complex traits. RATIONALEFor the first time, new large-scale datasets afford sufficient statistical power to identify genetic variants associated with same-sex sexual behavior (ever versus never had a same-sex partner), estimate the proportion of variation in the trait accounted for by all variants in aggregate, estimate the genetic correlation of same-sex sexual behavior with other traits, and probe the biology and complexity of the trait. To these ends, we performed genome-wide association discovery analyses on 477,522 individuals from the United Kingdom and United States, replication analyses in 15,142 individuals from the United States and Sweden, and follow-up analyses using different aspects of sexual preference. RESULTSIn the discovery samples (UK Biobank and 23andMe), five autosomal loci were significantly associated with same-sex sexual behavior. Follow-up of these loci suggested links to biological pathways that involve sex hormone regulation and olfaction. Three of the loci were significant in a meta-analysis of smaller, independent replication samples. Although only a few loci passed the stringent statistical corrections for genome-wide multiple testing and were replicated in other samples, our analyses show that many loci underlie same-sex sexual behavior in both sexes. In aggregate, all tested genetic variants accounted for 8 to 25% of variation in male and female same-sex sexual behavior, and the genetic influences were positively but imperfectly correlated between the sexes [genetic correlation coefficient (rg)= 0.63; 95% confidence intervals, 0.48 to 0.78]. These aggregate genetic influences partly overlapped with those on a variety of other traits, including externalizing behaviors such as smoking, cannabis use, risk-taking, and the personality trait “openness to experience.” Additional analyses suggested that sexual behavior, attraction, identity, and fantasies are influenced by a similar set of genetic variants (rg > 0.83); however, the genetic effects that differentiate heterosexual from same-sex sexual behavior are not the same as those that differ among nonheterosexuals with lower versus higher proportions of same-sex partners, which suggests that there is no single continuum from opposite-sex to same-sex preference. CONCLUSIONSame-sex sexual behavior is influenced by not one or a few genes but many. Overlap with genetic influences on other traits provides insights into the underlying biology of same-sex sexual behavior, and analysis of different aspects of sexual preference underscore its complexity and call into question the validity of bipolar continuum measures such as the Kinsey scale. Nevertheless, many uncertainties remain to be explored, including how sociocultural influences on sexual preference might interact with genetic influences. To help communicate our study to the broader public, we organized workshops in which representatives of the public, activists, and researchers discussed the rationale, results, and implications of our study. <img class=""fragment-image"" aria-describedby=""F1-caption"" src=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6456/eaat7693/F1.medium.gif""/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of same-sex sexual behavior reveals five loci and high polygenicity.Follow-up analyses show potential biological pathways; show genetic correlations with various traits; and indicate that sexual preference is a complex, heterogeneous phenotype. Twin and family studies have shown that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetically influenced, but previous searches for specific genes involved have been underpowered. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 477,522 individuals, revealing five loci significantly associated with same-sex sexual behavior. In aggregate, all tested genetic variants accounted for 8 to 25% of variation in same-sex sexual behavior, only partially overlapped between males and females, and do not allow meaningful prediction of an individual’s sexual behavior. Comparing these GWAS results with those for the proportion of same-sex to total number of sexual partners among nonheterosexuals suggests that there is no single continuum from opposite-sex to same-sex sexual behavior. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genetics underlying same-sex sexual behavior and underscore the complexity of sexuality. A genome-wide association study of same-sex sexual behavior identifies loci associated with human sexual orientation.

To address these issues, we undertook the first formal attempt to model the trajectory of smoking prevalence and indices of uptake and cessation in Great Britain from 1973 to 2016. Methods Using data from the General Lifestyle Survey between 1973 and 2008, the Integrated Household Survey between 2009 and 2014 and the Annual Population Survey between 2015 and 2016, this study modelled year-on-year changes in smoking prevalence, ever-smoking in 18–24-year-olds as an index of uptake, and quit ratios as an index of cessation. Results For all three outcomes, changes over time were best fitted by what may be broadly characterised as ‘S’-shaped curves: segmented functions characterised by initial rapid progress, a slowing or reversal, then renewed progress. Smoking prevalence in Great Britain showed a decelerating decline over time between 1973 and 2000, but then, after the introduction of the National ‘Smoking Kills’ tobacco control plan, the decline accelerated again and has remained nearly linear at −0.67 percentage points per year. Ever-smoking showed a decelerating decline which eventually ceased and began increasing around 1994 but then declined again after 2000. Quit ratios rose rapidly then slowed and then accelerated around 2000 and again more recently in 2013. Conclusion Long-term trends in smoking prevalence, uptake and cessation have followed a broadly ‘S’-shaped trend suggesting that they are responsive to major tobacco control initiatives. The decline in prevalence has resulted both from reductions in uptake and increases in cessation.","2019-09-01","2020-10-18 17:37:38","2020-10-18 17:37:38","2019-12-06 14:31:45","875-881","","9","74","","","‘S’-shaped curve","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Patients with cognitive deficits need support and assistance from their informal caregivers and often rely on them to manage their symptoms based on their degree of deficits. Patients spend a significant amount of time with their informal caregivers and become interdependent with each other. In spite of their interdependence, it is unclear whether patients’ cognitive outcomes (ie, cognitive function) are associated with their informal caregivers. Therefore, the body of literature related to the association between caregiver characteristics and cognitive function of adults with cancer needs to be fully mapped with assessment for knowledge gaps.</p><h3>Methods and analysis</h3> <p>Methods for this scoping review was informed by the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley. Seven electronic databases will be searched: (1) PubMed (MEDLINE), (2) CINAHL, (3) Embase, (4) PsycINFO, (5) Scopus, (6) Sociological Abstracts and (7) ProQuest dissertation abstracts. In addition, the search for grey literature will include the conference abstracts available through Embase, Scopus and Sociological abstracts as well as dissertations available in ProQuest dissertations. All retrieved citations will be independently screened by two authors and eligibility will be determined based on inclusion and exclusion criteria at title and abstract level. Studies meeting inclusion criteria, will be screened at full text level by two reviewers followed by abstraction of included studies. Eligible studies will be collated, summarised and reported using the data charting form that research team developed.</p><h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> <p>This scoping review does not require ethics approval.

In the present research, we argue that this counterproductive tendency may be driven, at least in part, by the aversive and self-threatening nature of experiencing financial deprivation. Accordingly, we propose that self-affirmation—an intervention known to buffer negative consequences of psychological threats—may reduce delay discounting of the financially deprived. Results of two high-powered, preregistered experiments support this proposition. Specifically, in Study 1 (n = 546), we show that among participants with relatively lower incomes, self-affirmation effectively reduces delay discounting. In Study 2 (n = 432), we manipulate the feeling of financial deprivation and demonstrate that self-affirmation reduces delay discounting among those who feel financially deprived. We also examine the underlying process of our proposed effect and find that self-affirmation bolsters a sense of personal control among those who feel financially deprived, which in turn reduces their delay discounting (Study 2). Overall, our findings show that psychological interventions that buffer self-threats and foster a sense of personal control can be applied to reduce myopic tendencies of the financially deprived in decision-making.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2019-08-27 15:18:47","","","","10","","Front.

We present two experiments investigating the importance of the shared context, that is, the amount of knowledge two interlocutors have in common, for the successful emergence and use of novel conventions. Using a referential communication task where black-and-white pictorial symbols are used to convey colors, pairs of participants build shared conventions peculiar to their dyad without experimenter feedback, relying purely on ostensive-inferential communication. Both experiments demonstrate that access to the visual context promotes more successful communication. Importantly, success improves cumulatively, supporting the view that pairs establish conventional ways of using the symbols to communicate. Furthermore, Experiment 2 suggests that dyads with access to the visual context successfully adapt the conventions built for one color space to another color space, unlike dyads lacking it. In linking experimental pragmatics with language evolution, the study illustrates the benefits of exploring the emergence of linguistic conventions using an ostensive-inferential model of communication.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2019-12-23 16:56:52","e12783","","9","43","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

Under the intuitive Cartesian dualism hypothesis, this is because it is natural to conceptualize of minds as separate from bodies; under the counterintuitiveness hypothesis, this is because beliefs in minds without bodies are unnatural—such beliefs violate core knowledge intuitions about person physicality and consequently have a social transmission advantage. We report on a critical test of these contrasting hypotheses. Prior research found that among adult Christian religious adherents, intuitions about person psychology coexist and interfere with theological conceptualizations of God (e.g., infallibility). Here, we use a sentence verification paradigm where participants are asked to evaluate as true or false statements on which core knowledge intuitions about person physicality and psychology and Christian theology about God are inconsistent (true on one and false on the other) versus consistent (both true or both false). We find, as predicted by the counterintuitiveness hypothesis but not the Cartesian dualism hypothesis, that Christian religious adherents show worse performance (lower accuracy and slower response time) on statements where Christian theological doctrines about God's physicality (e.g., incorporeality, omnipresence) conflict with intuitions about person physicality. We find these effects for other extraordinary beings in Christianity—the Holy Spirit and Jesus—but not for an ordinary being (priest). We conclude that it is unintuitive to conceptualize extraordinary beings as disembodied, and that this, rather than inherent Cartesian dualism, may explain the prevalence of beliefs in such beings.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-01-13 21:20:08","e12784","","9","43","","","The Embodied God","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Cognitive Science Society, Inc","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00000  https://osf.io/pf9vz/","","","","","Dualism; Counterintuitiveness; Disembodied mind; God; Holy Spirit; Religious beliefs; Representational coexistence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How people perceive the risk of a future terror attack abroad, and thus their travelling decisions, may be influenced by whether they think about the future in specific and personal terms (episodic future thinking) or in more general, abstract terms (semantic future thinking). In a pre-registered experiment (N = 277) we explored the potential impact of episodic future thinking on the perceived risk of terror attacks abroad. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) An episodic future thinking-condition, where participants were asked to imagine a specific, terror-related personal episode that might occur in the future while travelling abroad; 2) a semantic future thinking-condition, where participants were asked to think more abstractly about terror events that might occur in the future; 3) an episodic counterfactual thinking-condition, where participants were asked to imagine a specific, terror-related personal episode that might have occurred in the past while travelling abroad and 4) a passive control condition. Participants indicated their perceived risk of six different future terror attacks occurring abroad. The manipulation checks suggest that the experimental manipulations functioned as intended. Contrary to the central hypothesis of the study, there were no differences in the perceived risk of terror attacks between the experimental conditions. These results run counter to previous research and do not support the idea that how people think about the future influences their perceived risk of future dramatic events. Potential limitations and implications are discussed.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-01-28 20:09:03","","","","10","","Front.

(2016) reported that in an Austrian sample approximately one in ten respondents incorrectly believed that Austria still practices, or recently practiced, the death penalty, and that there is a positive association between the amount of weekly television viewing and this gross misperception of the Austrian justice system. Methods: An endorsed, prereviewed, preregistered close replication attempt (N = 597) served to test the veracity of these reported effects. This was coupled with an conceptual extension part, which (a) investigated the potential influence of watching American crime series, (b) accounted for further possible confounds, and (c) tested the generalizability of the effect of television viewing to online streaming. Results: Online survey data (N = 597) replicated the one-in-ten prevalence of incorrect answers with the 5-item death penalty questionnaire used in the original study, but not, when asking directly about Austria’s death penalty practices (prevalence: 0.3%). Younger age, but not the amount of television viewing or online streaming, suggestibility, or preferred TV genre turned consistently predicted incorrect answers in the death penalty questionnaire. Incorrect answers were Mokken-scalable (i.e., formed a common scale, complying with a nonparametric item response model) and were highly consistent. In contrast to the replication study results, a small meta-analysis of all available evidence (3 studies, including the present replication) suggested that the aggregate effect of television viewing nominally was significant, albeit small. Conclusion: The replication study yielded mixed results, which indicate a high prevalence of beliefs that there is capital punishment in a country without death penalty probably is due to a faultily designed questionnaire and thus a research artifact. Also, positive associations of television viewing with such beliefs likely are only small at best.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2019-08-01 18:23:47","","","","10","","Front.

We examined implementation in a randomly selected cross-sectional sample of 201 articles published in 2017 in the “best practice” journals, defined as having explicit supportive policies in 4 out of 5 domains.

It is typically measured in an oddball task and is computed as the difference of deviant minus standard tones. Previous studies suggest that the oddball MMN can be reduced by crossmodal attention to a concurrent, difficult visual task. However, more recent studies did not replicate this effect. Because previous findings seem to be biased, we preregistered the present study and used Bayesian hypothesis testing to measure the strength of evidence for or against an effect of visual task difficulty. We manipulated visual perceptual load (high and low load). In the task, the visual stimuli were identical for both loads to avoid confounding effects from physical differences of the visual stimuli. We also measured the corrected MMN because the oddball MMN may be confounded by physical differences between deviant and standard tones. The corrected MMN is obtained with a separate control condition in which the same tone as the deviant (critical tone) is equiprobable with other tones. The corrected MMN is computed as deviant minus critical tones. Furthermore, we assessed working memory capacity to examine its moderating role. In our large sample (N = 49), the evidential strength in support of no effect of visual load was moderate for the oddball MMN (9.09 > BF01 > 3.57) and anecdotal to moderate for the corrected MMN (4.55 > BF01 > 2.17). Also, working memory capacity did not correlate with the visual load effect on the oddball MMN and the corrected MMN. The present findings support the robustness of the auditory frequency MMN to manipulations of crossmodal, visual attention and suggest that this relationship is not moderated by working memory capacity.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2020-10-18 17:38:06","2019-12-06 15:09:48","","","","10","","Front.

However, empirical evidence for this assumption is scarce, especially for causal connections. The present study aims to directly assess the influence of dopamine activity on the established association between openness to experience and divergent thinking (i.e., an index of creativity). We hypothesized that manipulating dopamine activity alters the relationship between self-reported openness to experience and ideational fluency and flexibility. In a placebo-controlled between-subjects design, 193 healthy male volunteers completed four divergent thinking tasks after they received either the dopamine-receptor blocker sulpiride (200 mg) or a placebo. The data revealed an interaction such that openness to experience was more positively associated with divergent thinking in the dopamine blocker group (r = 0.304) than in the placebo group (r = −0.002). Specifically, highly open individuals in the dopamine blocker group reached the highest divergent thinking scores. Thus, sulpiride administration selectively affected divergent thinking as a function of trait levels of openness to experience. Although somewhat limited by the unexpected absence of the association between openness to experience and divergent thinking in the placebo group, the present study provides novel evidence for an association between dopamine activity and both openness to experience and divergent thinking.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2019-08-29 13:51:27","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge Core","","00000  https://osf.io/mv4xs/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e","","","","","dopamine; divergent thinking; openness to experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (‘old’), matched two antecedents (‘ambiguous’), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (‘partial-match’), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, ‘new’). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an ‘old/new’ judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2020-03-03 20:34:23","","","","13","","Front.

Increasingly, there has been a focus on the specific situations in which particular personality traits predict prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility—the basic trait most consistently linked to prosocial behaviour in prior studies—has been found to predict prosociality most strongly in situations that afford the exploitation of others. Importantly, though, it may be the subjectively perceived situation that affords the behavioural expression of a trait. Following this reasoning, we tested the proposition that Honesty-Humility would predict prosocial behaviour more strongly in situations characterised by, and perceived to contain, two dimensions of interdependence that can afford exploitation: high conflict and high power. However, across a series of incentivised economic games and two large experience sampling studies, we only found inconsistent evidence for the association between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, the link between Honesty-Humility and prosociality was neither conditional on objective interdependence nor on subjective perceptions of interdependence. Nonetheless, perceptions of conflict and power tracked objective properties of economic games and were related to prosocial behaviour in the lab and field. Future research should take individuals' subjective understanding of situations into account, which may also help understand the (generalisability of the) effect of Honesty-Humility on prosocial behaviour. © 2019 The Authors.

Adults are known to have a strong center bias, their first point of gaze is nearly always in the center of the scene. The center bias is likely to be a strategic bias, as looking towards the center minimizes the distance to other parts of the scene and important objects are often located at the center. In an experimental design varying salience regions of scenes and start positions we examined infants’ (N = 48, Age = 5–20-month-olds) first fixation after scene onset. The pre-registered hypothesis that infants also have a center bias while looking at real-world scenes was confirmed. The strength of the center bias is correlated with the saliency distribution such that the bias is weaker when the strongest salience is peripheral rather central. In the absence of clear salient regions there still was a strong center bias. These results suggests there is a competition between stimulus-driven factors and a center bias in steering attention from a young age onwards.","2019-01-01","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2018-11-13 21:20:12","44-53","","","154","","Vision Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000","","","","","Visual attention; Center bias; Infant eye movements; Scene perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aimed to demonstrate that attention has a causal influence on choice. We tested whether spatially biasing attention in a visual search task would produce choice biases in a later choice task. We ran four experiments where the search target was more likely to appear on one “rich” side of the screen. In the subsequent choice tasks, participants were more likely to choose items appearing on the rich side and the average choice bias depended on how well participants learned the regularity in the search task. Additionally, eye-tracking data revealed a first-fixation bias toward the rich side, which in turn influenced choices.

Eight experiments (N = 2,119) reveal that body cam video of an incident results in lower observer judgments of intentionality than dash cam video of the same incident, an effect documented with both scripted videos and real police videos. This effect was due, in part, to variation in the visual salience of the focal actor: the body cam wearer is typically less visually salient when depicted in body versus dash cam video, which corresponds with lower observer intentionality judgments. In showing how visual salience of the focal actor may introduce unique effects on observer judgment, this research establishes an empirical platform that may inform public policy regarding surveillance of police conduct.","2019-01-03","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2020-10-18 17:38:05","2019-01-14 19:36:07","201805928","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

We defined total exercise duration in minutes as the product of program duration, session duration, and frequency. For each study, we grouped test-specific Hedges’ d (n = 163) and Cohen’s d (n = 23) effect sizes in the domains Global cognition, Executive function and Memory. We used multilevel mixed-effects models to investigate dose-related predictors of exercise effects. In healthy older adults (n = 23 studies), there was a small positive effect of exercise on executive function (d = 0.27) and memory (d = 0.24), but dose-parameters did not predict the magnitude of effect sizes. In older adults with cognitive impairments (n = 13 studies), exercise had a moderate positive effect on global cognition (d = 0.37). For older adults with cognitive impairments, we found evidence for exercise programs with a short session duration and high frequency to predict higher effect sizes (d = 0.43–0.50). In healthy older adults, dose-parameters did not predict the magnitude of exercise effects on cognition.

We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (“fake news”). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans—mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans—every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.","2019-01-28","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2019-02-11 20:13:26","201806781","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

On the basis of decades of research, it should be especially effective when people adopt the perspective of individuals who hold alternative views. In the current research, however, we found the opposite: In three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,734), we found that taking the perspective of someone who endorses a counterattitudinal view lowers receptiveness to that view and reduces attitude change following a counterattitudinal-argument-generation task. This ironic effect can be understood through value congruence: Individuals who take the opposition’s perspective generate arguments that are incongruent with their own values, which diminishes receptiveness and attitude change. Thus, trying to “put yourself in their shoes” can ultimately undermine self-persuasion. Consistent with a value-congruence account, this backfire effect is attenuated when people take the perspective of someone who holds the counterattitudinal view yet has similar overall values.","2019-01-29","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2019-02-11 20:29:46","0956797618822697","","","","","Psychol Sci","Perspective Taking and Self-Persuasion","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/juah5/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the robust character of generalization, considerable variation in conditioned responding both between and within humans remains a challenge for contemporary generalization models. The current study aims to investigate the extent to which variation in behavior in a context of generalization can be attributed to differences in perception. We combined a fear conditioning and generalization procedure with a perceptual decision task in humans. We found that the failure to perceive a novel stimulus as different from the trained fear-evoking stimulus led to increased conditioned responding. Furthermore, perceptual errors yielded perceived stimulus-outcome contingencies that differed substantially from the objective contingencies. Final, the impact of a perceptual error was dependent upon these perceived contingencies. These findings suggest that generalization across a perceptual dimension is to a large extent driven by perceptual errors that directly affect behavior but also indirectly as they yield different learning experiences between individuals.","2019-01-18","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2020-10-18 17:38:00","2019-01-23 20:21:49","","","","","","Behaviour Research and Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/u3fcs/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67","","","","","Perception; Conditioning; Categorization; Fear generalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two particularly worrisome practices are selective reporting of significant results and ‘P-hacking’. The latter is the manipulation of data collection, usage, or analyses to obtain statistically significant outcomes. Here, we introduce the novel, to our knowledge, concepts of selective reporting of nonsignificant results and ‘reverse P-hacking’ whereby researchers ensure that tests produce a nonsignificant result. We test whether these practices occur in experiments in which researchers randomly assign subjects to treatment and control groups to minimise differences in confounding variables that might affect the focal outcome. By chance alone, 5% of tests for a group difference in confounding variables should yield a significant result (P < 0.05). If researchers less often report significant findings and/or reverse P-hack to avoid significant outcomes that undermine the ethos that experimental and control groups only differ with respect to actively manipulated variables, we expect significant results from tests for group differences to be under-represented in the literature. We surveyed the behavioural ecology literature and found significantly more nonsignificant P-values reported for tests of group differences in potentially confounding variables than the expected 95% (P = 0.005; N = 250 studies). This novel, to our knowledge, publication bias could result from selective reporting of nonsignificant results and/or from reverse P-hacking.

Thus, policies which make people engage in pro-environmental behavior are less likely to trigger cross-domain licensing than previously thought.","2019-02-01","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-18 15:51:37","","","","","","Journal of Environmental Psychology","Green consumption does not make people cheat","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/93z7b/","","","","","Cheating; Environmental attitude; Green consumption; Moral licensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extending this work, we investigated the effects of alcohol on recognition of six primary expressions of emotion.Methods:We conducted two studies using a 2 ? 6 experimental design with a between-subjects factor of drink (alcohol, placebo) and a within-subjects factor of emotion (anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, happiness, fear). Study one (n = 110) was followed by a direct replication study (n = 192). Participants completed a six alternative forced choice emotion recognition task following consumption of 0.4?g/kg alcohol or placebo. Dependent variables were recognition accuracy (i.e. hits) and false alarms.Results:There was no clear evidence of differences in recognition accuracy between groups (ps > .58). In study one, there were more false alarms for anger in the alcohol compared to placebo group (n = 52 and 56, respectively; t(94.6) = 2.26, p = .024, d = .44) and fewer false alarms for happiness (t(106) = ?2.42, p = .017, d = ?.47). However, no clear evidence for these effects was found in study two (alcohol group n = 96, placebo group n = 93, ps > .22). When the data were combined we observed weak evidence of an effect of alcohol on false alarms of anger (t(295) = 2.25, p = .025, d = .26).Conclusions:These studies find weak support for biased anger perception following acute alcohol consumption in social consumers, which could have implications for alcohol-related aggression. Future research should investigate the robustness of this effect, particularly in individuals high in trait aggression.","2019-02-05","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-18 16:10:42","0269881118822169","","","","","J Psychopharmacol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Debate surrounds the degree to which this effect is due to differentiation (e.g., Criss Journal of Memory and Language, 55, 461–478, 2006) or criterion shifts (e.g., Hicks & Starns Memory & Cognition, 42, 742–754, 2014). Problematically, differing underlying control processes may be equally capable of producing an SBME. The ability of criterion shifts to produce an SBME has been shown in prior work where differentiation was unlikely. The present work likewise produces an SBME under conditions where criterion shifts are unlikely. Specifically, we demonstrate that an SBME can be elicited without the typical number of trials needed to adjust one’s decision criterion (Experiments 1, 2, and 5) and using encoding manipulations that do not explicitly alert participants that their memory quality has changed (Experiments 3 and 4). When taken in the context of the broader literature, these results demonstrate the need to prioritize memory models that can predict SBMEs via multiple underlying processes.","2019-02-21","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-28 18:32:56","","","","","","Mem Cogn","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000  https://osf.io/bv6c3/","","","","","Recognition; Criterion-shifts; Differentiation; Strength based mirror effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This snapshot survey aimed to gather data on variation in access to quality GI endoscopy training for Colorectal and Upper Gastrointestinal(GI) surgical trainees across the UK and Ireland. Materials and methods An online 20-point survey was designed and distributed nationally to surgical trainee members of the Association of Surgeons in Training (ASiT), Dukes and The Roux Group (formerly Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland Trainees). The survey was designed in collaboration with The Roux Group for Upper GI trainees and the Dukes’ Club for Colorectal trainees. Results 218 responses were received, most with a Colorectal or Upper GI sub-specialty interest (colorectal 56.0%; upper GI surgery 25.7%). Only 28.6% of trainees attended a dedicated training endoscopy list at least once a week with 28.1% not attending any at all. Less than half of trainees reported having endoscopy formally timetabled on rotas(36.9%). Most trainees (88.0%) encountered difficulties in gaining endoscopy training including lack of available lists (77.2%), conflicting operative commitments (59.4%), preferential allocation of lists to gastroenterology trainees (57.9%) and resistance from endoscopy departmental leads (38.6%). Regarding JAG accreditation, 77.1% respondents felt it should be mandatory prior to CCT with 80.3% believing this would lead to better access to dedicated endoscopy training equivalent to gastroenterology trainees. 93.1% trainees felt that attaining JAG accreditation by surgical trainees was important to patient care. Discussion This study demonstrates significant barriers in accessing GI endoscopy training for general surgical trainees which urgently needs to be improved. In order to meet JAG training requirements for surgical trainees, a multifaceted collaborative approach from surgical and gastroenterology training bodies, local JAG trainers and the General Surgery SAC and JCST is required. This is to ensure that endoscopy is promoted and a robust model of training is successfully designed and delivered to general surgery trainees.","2019-01-30","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-11 20:31:43","","","","","","International Journal of Surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/bc3f8/register/564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2be","","","","","Accreditation; Endoscopy; JAG; Surgical Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Behavioral economics and economic psychology suggest various antidotes. In the present paper, we report two studies – a large-scale intervention field study and an experiment –that constitute independent, pre-registered, and open replication attempts of a recently-introduced intervention procedure: dynamic social norms. We tested whether a dynamic norm, along the lines of “more and more customers are switching from to-go-cups to a sustainable alternative. Be part of this movement and choose a reusable mug” –can help café customers to avoid disposable to-go-cups. Data from a fourteen-week intervention experiment with a total of 23,946 hot beverages sold –18,019 in disposable cups and 5,927 in reusable mugs–suggest that a dynamic-norm intervention for sustainable consumption helps customers avoid disposable cups and increases their use of reusable alternatives by 17.3% (or 4.1 percentage points). A follow-up online experiment corroborates this pattern and shows advantageous effects of a dynamic norm relative to a no-norm control condition, a static norm, an injunctive norm, and a combination of static-and-injunctive norm. In light of inconsistent and, at times, failed or even reversed replication results for seminal social norms studies, the present pre-registered studies indicate that dynamic norms are an effective means to facilitate sustainable behavior. We discuss scientific and applied implications and avenues for future research.","2019-02-04","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-18 16:09:30","","","","","","Journal of Economic Psychology","Dynamic Norms Drive Sustainable Consumption","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/mtwu2/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that valence-dependent learning asymmetries are partly driven by beliefs about the causal structure of the environment. If hidden causes can intervene to generate bad (or good) outcomes, then a rational observer will assign blame (or credit) to these hidden causes, rather than to the stable outcome distribution. Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how causal attributions contribute to biased learning.","2019-02-13","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2020-10-18 17:37:59","2019-02-22 15:24:40","0956797619828724","","","","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/cx4u9/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research with rats has demonstrated that secondary extinction can interfere with the return of conditioned fear after a reinstatement manipulation. Here we investigated this phenomenon in two pre-registered studies in humans. Method In both experiments, distinct CSs were paired with an electrical stimulation. Next, conditioned reactions to both CSs were extinguished and thereafter reinstated through the administration of three unsignaled electrical stimulations. Crucially, before participants continued with the reinstatement test, half of the participants received secondary extinction trials whereas the other half did not receive these trials. Results Our results indicate that secondary extinction reduced reinstatement of threat expectancies and skin conductance responses, but the effect on skin conductance was only found in the second experiment. Limitations The studies were conducted in a laboratory setting with healthy students.

We examined the association of PAS with motivation to stop in a population sample and assessed its association with past and future quit attempts and future quit success. Method 12,700 smokers in England were surveyed between September 2009–March 2012 as part of the Smoking Toolkit Study. 2796 smokers were followed up after 6 months. PAS was assessed at baseline by a single self-report item. The outcome variables were ratings of motivation to stop and reports of past-year quit attempts at baseline, and quit attempts in the past 6 months and smoking status at follow-up. Baseline covariates were sex, age, social grade and daily cigarette consumption. Results In adjusted analyses, PAS was positively associated with at least some degree of motivation to stop versus no motivation (ORs = 1.97–2.96, all p's < 0.001). PAS was also positively associated with past-year quit attempts (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.32–1.55, p < 0.001), but not with future quit attempts (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.99–1.39, p = 0.064) or quit success (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.73–1.47, p = 0.83). Conclusion In smokers in England, perceived addiction to smoking is positively associated with motivation to stop and having recently made a quit attempt but is not clearly associated with future quit attempts or success.

To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test.

For CS-US pairs from other conditions, accurate suggestions or no suggestions at all were given to participants. This manipulation significantly moderated EC effects. For pairs that were combined with inaccurate information we found a reversed EC effect, while we found a standard EC effect for both pairs combined with no suggestions and pairs combined with accurate suggestions. Additional analyses showed that the misinformation manipulation also moderated memory for the pairs. These results show that misinformation manipulations cannot only influence explicit memory but also attitudes. Furthermore, and in line with some theories of EC, they support the relevance of explicit memory for EC effects.","2019-03-01","2020-10-18 17:37:58","2020-10-18 17:37:58","2019-02-18 16:07:03","28-36","","","194","","Acta Psychologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/e3wcs/","","","","","Memory; False memory; Evaluative conditioning; Misinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

College undergraduates (n = 185, n = 100) read short, experiment-generated narratives manipulated in three ways. First, protagonist location was manipulated such that the goal was either completed or not, making subsequent critical sentences consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with the last-described location. Second, text distance between the manipulation of location and the later target sentence was varied such that the critical sentences were close to or distant from the last mention of location. Third, location words that explicitly mentioned the protagonist’s location were either present or not in the critical sentences. Readers took longer to read critical sentences when the protagonist had not been described as reaching the goal location, suggesting that readers were maintaining location information in highly-accessible state. This effect emerged with or without explicit location words in the critical sentences and with near or distant backgrounding.

We tested a Polish-speaking sample of 21 participants with ADOS-confirmed autism spectrum conditions (mean age 15.90) and 21 age- (mean age 15.86), sex- and IQ-matched neurotypical control participants. Procedure closely followed the replicated study. Participants’ task was to match five pairs of unfamiliar words and shapes.

We report partial replication of the diminished ‘kiki/bouba’ effect in individuals with ASC compared to the neurotypical control group. However, we found that nonverbal intelligence also significantly contributed to task performance, but only in participants with autism, suggesting a compensatory role of intelligence.

In the present research, we explored a link between perceived deprivation of Western Muslims and endorsement of extremism. We suggest that Western-born Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the impact of perceived relative deprivation because comparisons with majority groups’ peers are more salient for them than for individuals born elsewhere. Thus, we hypothesized that Western-born, compared with foreign-born, Muslims would score higher on four predictors of extremism (e.g., violent intentions), and group-based deprivation would explain these differences. Studies 1 to 6 (Ns = 59, 232, 259, 243, 104, and 366, respectively) confirmed that Western-born Muslims scored higher on all examined predictors of extremism.

However, it remains unclear how qualitative information, such as low-level visual salience, is reconstructed and how the precision and bias of this information relate to subjective memory vividness. Here, we tested whether remembered visual salience contributes to vivid recollection. In three experiments, participants studied emotionally negative and neutral images that varied in luminance and color saturation, and they reconstructed the visual salience of each image in a subsequent test. Results revealed, unexpectedly, that memories were recollected as less visually salient than they were encoded, demonstrating a novel memory-fading effect, whereas negative emotion increased subjective memory vividness and the precision with which visual features were encoded. Finally, memory vividness tracked both the precision and remembered salience (bias) of visual information. These findings provide evidence that low-level visual information fades in memory and contributes to the experience of vivid recollection.","2019-03-21","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2019-04-25 13:54:26","0956797619836093","","","","","Psychol Sci","Memories Fade","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/nsj65/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such tasks aim at tapping children’s and adults’ uninstructed, largely automatic mental state ascription, indicated in spontaneous looking behavior when observing agents who act on the basis of false beliefs. Studies with anticipatory looking, in particular, have suggested that basic ToM capacities operate from very early in life and remain in unconscious operation throughout the lifespan. Recently, however, systematic replication attempts of anticipatory looking measures have yielded a complex and puzzling mixture of successful, partial and non-replications. The present study aimed at shedding light on the question whether there is a system to this pattern. More specifically, in a set of three preregistered experiments, it was tested whether those conditions that could previously be replicated and those that could not differ in crucial conceptual respects such that the former do not strictly require ToM whereas the latter do. This was tested by the implementation of novel control conditions. The results were complex. There was generally no unambiguous evidence for reliable spontaneous ToM and no effect of the number of passed familiarization trials. Neither was there any unambiguous evidence that the previous mixed patterns of (non-)replications could be explained (away) by the sub-mentalizing account tested in the new control conditions. The empirical situation remains puzzling, and the question whether there is some such thing as implicit and spontaneous ToM remains to be clarified.","2019-03-25","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2019-04-17 17:46:03","","","3","14","","PLoS One","Why can some implicit Theory of Mind tasks be replicated and others cannot?","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","00000  https://osf.io/d47zk/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These expectations can develop over different timescales and are not always complementary. The present work examines how long-term (structural) expectations – developed over a lifetime - and short-term (contextual) expectations jointly affect perception. In two studies, including a pre-registered replication, participants initiated the movement of an ambiguously rotating sphere by operating a rotary switch. In the absence of any learning, participants predominantly perceived the sphere to rotate in the same direction as their rotary action. This bias toward structural expectations was abolished (but not reversed) when participants were exposed to incompatible action-effect contingencies (e.g., clockwise actions causing counterclockwise percepts) during a preceding learning phase. Exposure to compatible action-effect contingencies, however, did not add to the existing structural bias. Together, these findings reveal that perception of action-outcomes results from the combined influence of both long-term and immediate expectations.","2019-03-26","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2020-10-18 17:37:57","2019-04-17 17:47:53","5225","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","En","2019 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  https://osf.io/2j4mr/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these disparities suggest that racial biases are a contributor, no previous research has shown associations with psychological measurements of bias and disciplinary outcomes. We show that county-level estimates of racial bias, as measured using data from approximately 1.6 million visitors to the Project Implicit website, are associated with racial disciplinary disparities across approximately 96,000 schools in the United States, covering around 32 million white and black students. These associations do not extend to sexuality biases, showing the specificity of the effect.

In an experimental design, participants read one of four messages: clean meat is natural, conventional meat is unnatural, naturalness is not important, or highlighting benefits of clean meat without addressing naturalness. The results indicated that arguing that conventional meat is unnatural resulted in a significant increase in some measures of acceptance compared to other messages. Arguing that clean meat is natural and challenging the appeal to nature were less persuasive, and challenging the appeal to nature resulted in some measures of acceptance being lower than not addressing naturalness.

Depression positively predicted subsequent derailment across all components of the model, suggesting that perceived disruptions in life course may occur in response to elevated depressive symptoms.

These findings suggest that during language comprehension, mental simulations can be actively updated to reflect new incoming information.","2019-04-08","2020-10-18 17:37:56","2020-10-18 17:37:56","2019-04-15 19:55:57","","","","","","Mem Cogn","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000  https://osf.io/f7m3q/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67","","","","Updating; Language comprehension; Situation models; Discourse; Grounded cognition; Mental representation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four studies (N = 4,978) suggest that one’s reactions depend on the temporal location of outcome acquisition: Observers care more (e.g., feel more envy) right before, versus right after, other people have identical experiences (Studies 1, 2a, and 2b). For example, participants’ envy in February rose as Valentine’s Day approached (as a peer’s enviable date loomed in the future) but abruptly plateaued come February 15 onward (after the date occurred). Further, the passing of time specifically assuaged the pain of comparison (whereas positive reactions, such as feeling inspired, remained high; Studies 3a, 3b, and 3c); therefore, taking a past perspective can be used to regulate negative emotions in the present (Study 4). Time asymmetrically shapes the experience of upward comparison, despite other people’s desirable outcomes indeed being achieved. Other people’s good lives sting less if they have already lived them.","2019-04-08","2020-10-18 17:37:56","2020-10-18 17:37:56","2019-04-15 20:02:31","0956797619839689","","","","","Psychol Sci","Yesterday’s News","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","https://osf.io/buvpk/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In preclinical biomedical research, it is common practice to conduct exact replications with the same sample sizes as those used in the initial experiments. Such replication attempts, however, have lower probability of replication than is generally appreciated. Indeed, in the common scenario of an effect just reaching statistical significance, the statistical power of the replication experiment assuming the same effect size is approximately 50%—in essence, a coin toss. Accordingly, we use the provocative analogy of “replicating” a neuroprotective drug animal study with a coin flip to highlight the need for larger sample sizes in replication experiments. Additionally, we provide detailed background for the probability of obtaining a significant p value in a replication experiment and discuss the variability of p values as well as pitfalls of simple binary significance testing in both initial preclinical experiments and replication studies with small sample sizes. We conclude that power analysis for determining the sample size for a replication study is obligatory within the currently dominant hypothesis testing framework. Moreover, publications should include effect size point estimates and corresponding measures of precision, e.g., confidence intervals, to allow readers to assess the magnitude and direction of reported effects and to potentially combine the results of initial and replication study later through Bayesian or meta-analytic approaches.","2019-04-09","2020-10-18 17:37:55","2020-10-18 17:37:55","2019-04-15 16:01:38","e3000188","","4","17","","PLOS Biology","Exact replication","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/zb3jv/","","","","","Forecasting; Scientists; Metaanalysis; Replication studies; Animal studies; Head; Publication practices; Web-based applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such operations are thought to tap Theory of Mind (ToM), with its importance underscored by the link between ToM impairment and a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Autism and Schizophrenia). Extensive investigations into the neural substrates of ToM, when individuals have to make overt/explicit judgments concerning others, have highlighted a link with a network of regions including the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), particularly in the right hemisphere. Recently, evidence has emerged that ToM can also operate implicitly and that this may be particularly impaired in Autism. However, very few studies have examined the neural basis of implicit ToM and none have employed methods allowing casual inferences to be made. Here, using brain stimulation, a Sally-Anne false-belief task, and eye-tracking we show that right TPJ is causally involved in ToM judgments that are made implicitly. These findings have implications for characterising the neural substrates of a key executive function, determining the extent to which implicit and explicit ToM draw on overlapping neural architecture and, potentially, better understanding of disorders tied to ToM impairment.","2019-04-11","2020-10-18 17:37:55","2020-10-18 17:37:55","2019-04-16 15:16:38","","","","","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/rxpb2/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) recently reported by Kara et al. (2018) showed that selected prototypic antidepressants reduced immobility time of mice in the FST across a variety of experimental designs. Despite differences in the procedures for SRMA, these results resemble the interim data collected by our research group according to a protocol deposited in the Systematic Review Facility and Open Science Framework (osf.io/9kxm4). Both studies detected a high amount of publications reporting statistically significant results and agreement with the primary hypothesis raising the possibility of publication bias in the field of FST. In our preliminary analysis, no evidence for publication bias was observed. However, the present work was limited to the effects of imipramine (doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg/kg) in different strains of mice. Therefore, more comprehensive studies are required to evaluate the risk of publication bias in the field of basic antidepressant research. We see the need to expand the current preliminary studies to evaluate the risk of publication bias within the preclinical research using the FST. Appraisal of the risk of publication bias may avoid misestimated effects of drugs in the FST providing better bases for the discovery of new antidepressants.","2018-06-07","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2018-06-14 19:31:45","","","","","","Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/7f4dy/","","","","","Meta-analysis; Animal models; Reproducibility; Validity; Antidepressants; Systematic Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report evidence of a form of gender bias that may contribute to this state: gender influences the way that people speak about professionals. When discussing professionals or their work, it is common to refer to them by surname alone (e.g., “Darwin developed the theory of evolution”). We present evidence that people are more likely to refer to male than female professionals in this way. This gender bias emerges in archival data across domains; students reviewing professors online and pundits discussing politicians on the radio are more likely to use surname when speaking about a man (vs. a woman). Participants’ self-reported references also indicate a preference for using surname when speaking about male (vs. female) scientists, authors, and others. Finally, experimental evidence provides convergent evidence: participants writing about a fictional male scientist are more likely to refer to him by surname than participants writing about an otherwise identical female scientist. We find that, on average, people are over twice as likely to refer to male professionals by surname than female professionals. Critically, we identified consequences of this gender bias in speaking about professionals. Researchers referred to by surname are judged as more famous and eminent. They are consequently seen as higher status and more deserving of eminence-related benefits and awards. For instance, scientists referred to by surname were seen as 14% more deserving of a National Science Foundation career award.","2018-06-20","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2018-07-02 18:45:04","201805284","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 .

Participants from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom played iterated Trust Games with trustworthy and untrustworthy members of both ingroups and outgroups. We show that the influence of group membership on trust decisions depended on the valence of the interactions with individual group members. When interacting with trustworthy partners, people displayed outgroup favouritism throughout the game, investing higher in outgroup members than ingroup members. However, for untrustworthy partners, initial outgroup favouritism disappeared, and ingroup and outgroup members were equally distrusted by the end of the game. Our work suggests that when individual experience is integrated with group-based biases, group membership influences trust decisions over time, but mostly when experiences are positive. These findings are discussed in relation to complexity-extremity theory and previous work on learning in the Trust Game.","2018-07","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2020-10-18 17:38:17","2018-04-30 17:50:07","36-49","","","77","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/3vney/register/5730e99a9ad5a102c5745a8a","","","","","Learning; Trust; Ingroup favouritism; Intergroup bias; Trust Game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we elicited eye-movement errors using the classic oculomotor capture paradigm, in which people tend to look at sudden onsets even when they are irrelevant. In the first experiment, participants were able to report their own errors on about a quarter of the trials on which they occurred. The aim of the second experiment was to assess what differentiates errors that are detected from those that are not. Specifically, we estimated the relative influence of two possible factors: how long the onset distractor was fixated (dwell time), and a measure of how much attention was allocated to the onset distractor. Longer dwell times were associated with awareness of the error, but the measure of attention was not. The effect of the distractor identity on target discrimination reaction time was similar whether or not the participant was aware they had fixated the distractor. The results suggest that both attentional and oculomotor capture can occur in the absence of awareness, and have important implications for our understanding of the relationship between attention, eye movements, and awareness.","2018-07-02","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-07-11 20:34:26","1-14","","","","","Atten Percept Psychophys","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000  https://osf.io/an8gj","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the precise social-cognitive mechanisms that drive this relationship remain elusive. Social Working Memory (SWM)—the ability to actively maintain and manipulate social information—has been proposed as a potential mechanism, but, to date, has not been linked to network size. Here, we explicitly tested this association.MethodsIn Study 1, 125 participants completed a SWM task and reported on their social networks. In Study 2, 25 participants underwent fMRI during the SWM task and reported on their social networks.ResultsAs predicted, in Study 1, SWM performance was significantly associated with social network size and, specifically, “Sympathy Group” size (i.e., the size of one’s core friend group). In Study 2, we conceptually replicated and extended this effect by showing that neural activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex engaged during SWM (vs. non-social working memory) was associated with individual variation in Sympathy Group size.ConclusionsTaken together, these findings provide the first evidence that SWM constrains social network size, and suggest that SWM may be one social cognitive competency that underlies the Social Brain Hypothesis. In addition, whereas prior work investigating the Social Brain Hypothesis has largely focused on correlating brain structure size with social network size, to our knowledge, this is the first functional imaging evidence supporting the Social Brain Hypothesis.","2018-07-27","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-07-31 18:30:34","1-13","","","","","Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000  https://osf.io/7jw5b/","<p>Study 2 was supported by a National Institute of Mental Health Pre-doctoral Ruth L.

Despite numerous publications that seem to answer this question affirmatively, divergent results from recent meta-analyses and pre-registered replication efforts suggest that the issue is not yet settled. Uncertainty lingers around (i) whether the effects of religious cognition on prosocial behaviour were obtained through implicit cognitive processes, explicit cognitive processes or both and (ii) whether religious cognition increases generosity only among people disinclined to share with anonymous strangers. Here, we report two experiments designed to address these concerns. In Experiment 1, we sought to replicate Shariff and Norenzayan's demonstration of the effects of implicit religious priming on Dictator Game transfers to anonymous strangers; unlike Shariff and Norenzayan, however, we used an online environment where anonymity was virtually assured. In Experiment 2, we introduced a ‘taking’ option to allow greater expression of baseline selfishness. In both experiments, we sought to activate religious cognition implicitly and explicitly, and we investigated the possibility that religious priming depends on the extent to which subjects view God as a punishing, authoritarian figure. Results indicated that in both experiments, religious subjects transferred more money on average than did non-religious subjects. Bayesian analyses supported the null hypothesis that implicit religious priming did not increase Dictator Game transfers in either experiment, even among religious subjects. Collectively, the two experiments furnished support for a small but reliable effect of explicit priming, though among religious subjects only. Neither experiment supported the hypothesis that the effect of religious priming depends on viewing God as a punishing figure. Finally, in a meta-analysis of relevant studies, we found that the overall effect of implicit religious priming on Dictator Game transfers was small and did not statistically differ from zero.","2018-08-01","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-08-30 15:48:49","170238","","8","5","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

Shifting social identities may be an under-appreciated explanation of this gap: identification with environmentalists in the U.S. dropped from 78% to 42% since 1991. In four pre-registered studies of U.S. residents (total N = 2,033), we explored the predictors and outcomes of environmentalist identity. We also developed a novel implicit measure of less deliberate aspects of environmentalist identity. We used explicit and implicit environmentalist identity to predict self-reported environmental behaviors and policy preferences. Meta-analysis of our pre-registered studies revealed that explicit identity was moderately associated with implicit identity (r = 0.24). Explicit identity strongly and uniquely predicted pro-environmental behaviors and policy preferences (partial rs = .58, .62), while implicit identity did not uniquely predict either (partial rs = .05, .05). Our findings highlight the importance of social identity in conservation.","2018-08-01","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-07-24 18:20:05","8-17","","","58","","Journal of Environmental Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/84g5v/registrations/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test this, we used well-validated materials and procedures, a double-blind design, a pre-registered analysis plan, and a combination of facial electromyography (EMG) and continuous flash suppression techniques to measure unconscious emotions. Our results show that East Asian (and Western Caucasian) female receivers exposed to the sweat (body odor) of fearful, happy, and neutral Western Caucasian male senders emulate these respective states based on body odors, outside of awareness. More specifically, East Asian (and Western Caucasian) receivers demonstrated significantly different patterns of facial muscle activity when being exposed to fear odor, happy odor, and neutral odor. Furthermore, fear odor decreased the suppression time of all faces on an interocular suppression task (IST), indicating subconscious vigilance, whereas happy odor increased the detection speed of happy faces.

We tested whether we could obtain similar findings in a high-powered preregistered study and whether hazardous drinking moderates these effects. Method Before the intervention, 122 French college students were screened for hazardous drinking using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Implicit evaluation of alcohol was assessed before and immediately after the intervention using an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Drinking behavior was assessed before the intervention and approximately two weeks after using the TimeLine Follow Back (TLFB) method. The EC consisted of 120 trials of words (related to alcoholic beverages, soft drinks or neutral) paired with pictures (neutral, positive or negative). In the EC condition, alcohol-related words were systematically paired with negative pictures. In the control condition, alcohol-related words were systematically paired with neutral pictures. Results The EC did not change the implicit evaluation of alcohol, Cohen's d = 0.01, 95CI [−0.35, 0.35]. However, the EC reduced drinking behavior, Cohen's d = 0.37, 95CI [0.01, 0.72]. This effect was independent of hazardous drinking behavior, but it was especially pronounced among participants with the most positive implicit evaluation of alcohol before the intervention. Conclusion This preregistered study suggests that evaluative conditioning can successfully reduce drinking behavior among college students by 31% (compared to 4% in the control condition) without causing an immediate change in the implicit evaluation of alcohol.","2018-07","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-02-23 15:33:43","14-18","","","82","","Addictive Behaviors","Evaluative conditioning","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/q62vg/register/564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2c0","","","","","Replication; Brief intervention; Evaluative conditioning; Drinking behaviors; Implicit evaluation; Preregistered study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our previous work, we have shown that memory biases decisions in the sense that better-memorized choice options are preferred, even if these options are comparatively unattractive. However, the cognitive mechanisms that drive this memory bias remain unclear. In the current pre-registered study, we tested the hypothesis that the memory bias arises because people believe they remember better options more often than worse options. Specifically, we predicted a positive correlation between the memory bias on value-based decisions and the belief in value-dependent memory performance. This prediction was confirmed. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that memory performance was indeed higher for more attractive options, indicating that letting decisions be influenced by memory can be an adaptive strategy. However, the memory bias persisted after correcting for this effect, suggesting that it is not simply an artifact of unequal memory performance. Our results highlight a critical influence of beliefs on behavior and add to an emerging understanding of the role of memory in shaping value-based decisions.","2018-07-12","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2020-10-18 17:38:16","2018-07-17 20:36:22","10592","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","00000  https://osf.io/ze8xh/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study used a novel rolling group format for MBRP as an additional intervention for young adults in residential treatment. We tested the hypothesis that MBRP (plus Treatment as usual (TAU)) would reduce stress, craving, and substance use among young adults in residential treatment relative to treatment-as-usual plus 12-step/self-help meetings (TAU only). Further, we examined whether reduced stress during treatment was a potential mechanism of change operating in MBRP. Method Seventy-nine young adults (Mage = 25.3,SD = 2.7;35 % female) were randomly assigned to MBRP (n = 44) or TAU (n = 35). Follow-up assessments were conducted bi-monthly for self-reported measures of stress, craving, and substance use. Results At treatment completion young adults receiving MBRP had lower substance use (d = −0.58, [−0.91, −0.26]), craving (d = −0.58, [−1.0, −0.14]), and stress (d = −0.77 [−1.2, −0.30]) relative to TAU condition.

While the common-sense view is that feedback is helpful during learning, relatively little empirical evidence exists about the role of feedback in spoken vocabulary learning. Some work has suggested that long-term word learning is not enhanced by the presence of feedback, and that words are best learned implicitly. It is also plausible that feedback might have differential effects when learners focus on learning semantic facts, or when they focus on learning a new phonological sequence of sounds. In this study, we assess how providing evaluative (right/wrong) feedback on a spoken response influences two different components of vocabulary learning, the learning of a new phonological form, and the learning of a semantic property of the phonological form. We find that receiving evaluative feedback improves retention of phonological forms, but not of semantic facts.","2018-09-01","2020-10-18 17:38:15","2020-10-18 17:38:15","2018-09-12 14:48:03","171496","","9","5","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

In their Experiment 1, participants descrambled sets of words to form sentences. In one condition, 80% of the descrambled sentences described hostile behaviors, and in another condition, 20% described hostile behaviors. Following the descrambling task, all participants read a vignette about a man named Donald who behaved in an ambiguously hostile manner and then rated him on a set of personality traits. Next, participants rated the hostility of various ambiguously hostile behaviors (all ratings on scales from 0 to 10).

Method We conducted an online between-subjects experiment with two tasks to examine the impact of alcohol labels. In one task, participants were randomized to view one of four different unit labels (including labels currently used by the alcohol industry and novel labels which provide more information about how the number of units relates to recommended drinking guidelines). We assessed participants’ accuracy of estimating weekly serving limits of alcohol. In a second task, participants were randomized to view one of eight health warnings (which varied according to message content, specificity, and framing). We assessed the motivation to quit after viewing the health warning. Results Accuracy of estimating weekly serving limits of alcohol was greater for participants who viewed novel unit labels compared to the industry standard labels. Motivation to drink less was higher amongst participants who had viewed both cancer and negatively framed messages, compared to mental health and positively framed messages. Conclusion Existing unit labels used by the alcohol industry can be improved; the inclusion of unit information per serving and how these relate to low-risk drinking guidelines may be important for facilitating consumer understanding. Health warning labels should be included alongside units to provide consumers with information about the harms associated with alcohol and discourage riskier drinking behavior.","2018-09-12","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2018-09-24 18:20:29","","","","","","Drug and Alcohol Dependence","Informing drinkers","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/5bkjx/","","","","","Public Health; Alcohol Health Warnings; Alcohol Labeling; Alcohol Units; Consumer Knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In three experiments (total N = 344), we gradually reduced the presentation durations of inward and outward wandering words from 1000 ms down to 25 ms to approximate the minimum length of visual stimulus presentation required to trigger the effect. The in–out effect was reliably observed for exposure timings down to 50 ms, but vanished for 25 ms timings, which is line with previous evidence on phonological encoding. Thus, impressively, 50 ms of word presentation is sufficient to evoke the in–out effect.

We consider drinking identity importance (i.e., how important one considers it to be) and drinking identity thought frequency (i.e., how frequently one thinks about it). We investigated these dimensions from two perspectives: an absolute perspective (i.e., investment in drinking identity irrespective of other identities) and a relative perspective (i.e., investment in drinking identity compared to identities associated with other life domains [education, well-being, and personal relationships]). We aimed to evaluate whether these investment dimensions were positively associated with alcohol consumption and risk of alcohol use disorder either in interaction with or in addition to endorsement of drinking identity. College students (N = 521) who were screened for exhibiting hazardous drinking completed self-report measures of alcohol consumption, risk of alcohol use disorder, and drinking identity endorsement and investment. Controlling for gender and drinking identity endorsement, absolute and relative drinking identity thought frequency were uniquely and positively associated with alcohol consumption and risk of alcohol use disorder.

We offer an integrative neural model of self-transcendence in the context of persuasive messaging by examining the mechanisms of self-transcendence in promoting receptivity to health messages and behavior change. Specifically, we posited that focusing on values and activities that transcend the self can allow people to see that their self-worth is not tied to a specific behavior in question, and in turn become more receptive to subsequent, otherwise threatening health information. To test whether inducing self-transcendent mindsets before message delivery would help overcome defensiveness and increase receptivity, we used two priming tasks, affirmation and compassion, to elicit a transcendent mindset among 220 sedentary adults. As preregistered, those who completed a self-transcendence task before health message exposure, compared with controls, showed greater increases in objectively logged levels of physical activity throughout the following month. In the brain, self-transcendence tasks up-regulated activity in a region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, chosen for its role in positive valuation and reward processing. During subsequent health message exposure, self-transcendence priming was associated with increased activity in subregions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, implicated in self-related processing and positive valuation, which predicted later decreases in sedentary behavior. The present findings suggest that having a positive self-transcendent mindset can increase behavior change, in part by increasing neural receptivity to health messaging.","2018-09-13","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2018-09-24 18:29:06","201805573","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 .

The degree of map plasticity is influenced by the intensity and pulse width of VNS, number of VNS-event pairings, and the interval between each pairing. It is likely that these parameters interact, influencing optimal implementation of VNS pairing protocols. We varied VNS intensity, number of stimulations, and inter-stimulation interval (ISI) to test for interactions among these parameters. Rats were implanted with a vagus nerve stimulating cuff and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups to receive 20 days of VNS paired with a 9-kHz tone: (1) Fast VNS: 50 daily pairings of 400-µA VNS with a 30-s ISI; (2) Dispersed VNS: 50 daily pairings of 400-µA VNS with a 180-s ISI; and (3) Standard VNS: 300 daily pairings of 800-µA VNS with a 30-s ISI. Following 20 days of VNS-tone pairing, multi-unit recordings were conducted in primary auditory cortex (A1) and receptive field properties were analyzed. Increasing ISI (Dispersed VNS) did not lead to an enhancement of cortical plasticity. Reducing the current intensity and number of stimulations (Fast VNS) resulted in robust cortical plasticity, using 6 times fewer VNS pairings than the Standard protocol. These findings reveal an interaction between current intensity, stimulation number, and ISI and identify a novel VNS paradigm that is substantially more efficient than the previous standard paradigm.","2018-09-15","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2020-10-18 17:38:14","2018-08-07 17:34:11","239-247","","","388","","Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/3Y7U8/","","","","","auditory cortex; cortical plasticity; current intensity; inter-stimulation interval; stimulation parameters; vagal nerve stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After one and two years of intervention, we quantified fecal indicator bacteria in samples of drinking water (from source or storage), child hands, children’s food and sentinel objects. In households receiving single water treatment interventions, E. coli prevalence in stored drinking water was reduced by 50% and concentration by 1-log. E. coli prevalence in food was reduced by 30% and concentration by 0.5-log in households receiving single water treatment and handwashing interventions. Combined WSH did not reduce fecal contamination more effectively than its components. Interventions did not reduce E. coli in groundwater, on child hands and on objects. These findings suggest that WSH improvements reduced contamination along the direct transmission pathways of stored water and food but not along indirect upstream pathways.

For example, give and hand, which denote transfer of possession, both appear in the prepositional-object construction: “The child gave/handed the ball to the dog.” We can call the child a “giver” in one case and a “hander” in the other, or we can refer to her more generally as the agent, or doer of the action. Similarly, the dog can be called the recipient, and the ball, the theme. These generalized notions of agent, recipient, and theme are known as thematic roles. An important theoretical question for linguists and psycholinguists is what the set of thematic roles is. Are there a small number of very broad roles, perhaps with each one mapping onto a single canonical syntactic position? Or are there many distinct roles, several mapping to the same syntactic position but conveying subtly different meanings? We investigate this question across eleven structural priming experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (total N = 2914), asking whether speakers treat the thematic roles recipient and destination (i.e., location or spatial goal) as interchangeable, suggesting the broad role of goal, or distinct, suggesting two separate roles. To do so, we look for priming between dative sentences (e.g., “The man gave the ball to the dog”), which have a recipient role (dog), and locative sentences (e.g., “The man loaded hay onto the wagon”), which instead have a destination role (wagon).

The training was part of the Let's Move It (LMI) multi-level school-based intervention that aimed to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity among older adolescents, drawing on insights from social psychological theories, such as the reasoned action approach, self-regulation approaches and habit formation. We explore (1) whether the intervention increased teachers' use of sitting reduction strategies, (2) whether theoretical mechanisms mediated these changes, and (3) how teachers utilized habit formation. This pragmatic experimental study of vocational school teachers (n = 234) was embedded within a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating LMI, in which schools were randomized to intervention or no-treatment control arms. Three intervention workshops targeted skills and motivation to use sitting reduction strategies in class (e.g., active teaching methods, activity breaks). Participants self-reported sitting reduction activities, theoretical mediators, and use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) at baseline and 8-weeks follow-up. Compared to controls, intervention schools' teachers increased breaks to interrupt sitting, but not their outcome expectations, perceived behavioural control or intentions – potentially due to ceiling effects. Effects were mediated by BCT use and perceived behavioural control. Descriptive norms mediated the effects of the intervention on intention, which in turn mediated the intervention effects on BCT use.

Disappointingly, however, most new therapies fail when they are tested in clinical trials. Although the causes of this “translational attrition” are diverse and often rooted in the complexity of the underlying biology, it has also become clear that methodology is a major issue. The “translational roadblock”, along with what has been dubbed a “reproducibility crisis” [1], has fueled discussions about the reliability and reproducibility of biomedical research in general. There is strong evidence that weaknesses in planning, conducting, analyzing, and (non)reporting of research [2], as well as misidentification or contamination of reagents, biologicals, and cell lines [3], are prevalent factors. Meta‐research has shown that these problems can lead to an inflation of effect size and false positives and consequently decrease the reproducibility and predictiveness of research results. At the same time, the increasing methodological complexity combined with the immense proliferation in research outputs greatly complicates the production and evaluation of reliable evidence. Pressure to publish and hypercompetition for resources further compromise the robustness and rigor of research. Arguably, basic and translational biomedical research has a quality problem. In the 1970s, US cars had major quality problems. By comparison, Japanese cars were much more reliable. The introduction of rigorous quality management in the production process was largely credited for this competitive advantage, which helped the Japanese car industry to dominate the market for decades to come. By now, most industries, including US car manufacturers, the health and pharmaceutical industries as well as clinical medicine, have established sophisticated quality management systems (QMS) on which they spend several percent of their budget.

Outstanding questions concern its role in the flexibility with which such biases can be changed. The goal of this preregistered study was to examine the role of the NE/stress system in the degree to which biases can be trained along the axis of valence in the direction of reward. Participants genotyped for a common deletion variant of ADRA2b (linked to altered NE availability) experienced either an acute stress induction or a control procedure. Following stress induction, a “bias probe” task was presented before and after training. In the bias probe task, participants made forced choice judgments (happy or angry) on emotional faces with varying degrees of ambiguity. For bias training, participants viewed unambiguously angry faces in a task exploiting visual adaptation effects. The results revealed an overall shift from a slightly positive bias in categorizing faces pretraining to a more positive bias after training. Carriers of the deletion variant overall showed a more positive bias than did the noncarriers. Follow-up analyses showed that pretraining bias was a significant predictor of bias change, with those who showed a more negative bias preadaptation changing more in a positive direction. Critically, this effect was observed under control but not under stress conditions. These results suggest that the NE/stress system plays an important role in influencing trait-like biases as well as short-term changes in the tendency to perceive ambiguous stimuli as being more rewarding than threatening.","2018-10-24","2020-10-18 17:38:10","2020-10-18 17:38:10","2018-10-31 15:14:19","","","","","","Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00000","","","","","Motivation; Reward; Emotion; Norephinephrine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenging the assumption that low power tends to produce opposite consequences of high power, we highlight several similarities between the two states. Based on social exchange theories, we propose that unequal-power (vs. equal-power) relationships make instrumental goals, competitive attitudes, and exchange rules salient, which can cause both high- and low-power individuals to behave similarly. Two experiments suggest that although low-power individuals sometimes behave in opposite ways to high-power individuals (i.e., they take less action), at other times they behave similarly (i.e., they objectify others to the same extent).

There was no evidence for an effect of housing conditions on the sensitivity of contextual fear memory to amnestic effects of post-reactivation midazolam administration, and no indication for amnestic effects of post-reactivation midazolam overall (including in the standard group). The inability to replicate previous demonstrations of post-reactivation amnesia using the same protocol underscores the subtle nature of post-reactivation pharmacological memory interference.

The McGurk effect is robust and easily replicated in pooled group data, but there is tremendous variability in the extent to which individual participants are susceptible to it. In some studies, the rate at which individuals report fusion responses ranges from 0% to 100%. Despite its widespread use in the audiovisual speech perception literature, the roots of the wide variability in McGurk susceptibility are largely unknown. This study evaluated whether several perceptual and cognitive traits are related to McGurk susceptibility through correlational analyses and mixed effects modeling. We found that an individual’s susceptibility to the McGurk effect was related to their ability to extract place of articulation information from the visual signal (i.e., a more fine-grained analysis of lipreading ability), but not to scores on tasks measuring attentional control, processing speed, working memory capacity, or auditory perceptual gradiency. These results provide support for the claim that a small amount of the variability in susceptibility to the McGurk effect is attributable to lipreading skill. In contrast, cognitive and perceptual abilities that are commonly used predictors in individual differences studies do not appear to underlie susceptibility to the McGurk effect.","2018-11-12","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2018-11-19 14:52:43","e0207160","","11","13","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","00000","","","","","Cognition; Perception; Cognitive psychology; Working memory; Speech; Sensory perception; Vision; Syllables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One contributing factor is that individuals frequently forgo healthy foods in favor of inexpensive, high-calorie, unhealthy foods. One important mechanism underlying these choices is food craving: Craving increases with exposure to unhealthy foods (and food cues, such as advertisements) and prospectively predicts eating and weight. Prior work has shown that cognitive regulation strategies that emphasize the negative consequences of unhealthy foods reduce craving. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that cognitive strategies also increase craving for healthy foods by emphasizing their positive benefits, and change food valuation (willingness to pay) for both healthy and unhealthy foods. In Studies 3 and 4, we demonstrate that brief training in cognitive strategies (“Regulation of Craving Training”; ROC-T) increases subsequent healthy (vs. unhealthy) food choices. This was striking because this change in food choices generalized to nontrained items. Importantly, in Study 5, we show that brief training in cognitive strategies also reduces food consumption by 93–121 calories. Consumed calories correlated with changes in food choice. Finally, in Study 6, we show that the training component of ROC-T is necessary, above and beyond any effect of framing. Across all studies (NTOTAL = 1,528), we find that cognitive strategies substantially change craving and food valuation, and that training in cognitive strategies improves food choices by 5.4–11.2% and reduces unhealthy eating, including in obese individuals. Thus, these findings have important theoretical, public health, and clinical implications for obesity prevention and treatment.","2018-11-07","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2018-11-19 15:03:06","201717092","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 .

In this study, we investigated the effects of voluntary memberships and volunteering on alcohol and tobacco consumption in age comparison. Methods Preregistration is accessible at https://osf.io/qhkrn/. We used data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984–2015), where alcohol consumption was assessed in 2006, 2008, and 2010 and smoking was assessed at least biennially since 1998. We divided participants into three age groups (14–29, 40–50, and 65–75 years of age at baseline). To disentangle intraindividual change over time and interindividual differences (potential selection effects), we employed multilevel analysis. Results At the within level, voluntary memberships at one occasion predicted higher alcohol consumption a year later in middle-aged and older adults, but memberships had no significant longitudinal effects on smoking. Several positive effects of volunteering on alcohol and tobacco use one year later were found in males. No significant differences in the longitudinal effects between age groups or between nonpolitical and political volunteering emerged. At the between level, voluntary memberships and volunteering were usually associated with more alcohol consumption at low and moderate levels but with less smoking. Discussion Over time, voluntary memberships and volunteering in Germany appear to promote, rather than to protect against, alcohol and tobacco use. On average, more engaged individuals drink more (at moderate levels) and smoke less, which may be due to selection effects.","2018-11-13","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2018-11-19 15:04:48","","","","","","Drug and Alcohol Dependence","Effects of voluntary memberships and volunteering on alcohol and tobacco use across the life course","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000","","","","","Civic Engagement; Light and Moderate Drinking; Multilevel Analysis; Smoking Status and Intensity; Social Participation; Structural Social Capital","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its growing prevalence, consequences of this constant orientation toward online streams of information and communication for users' well-being are largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether being constantly vigilant is related to cognitive consequences in the form of increased mind-wandering and decreased mindfulness and examined the resulting implications for well-being. To test our assumptions, we estimated a path model based on survey data (N = 371). The model supported the majority of our preregistered hypotheses: online vigilance was indeed related to mind-wandering and mindfulness, but only mindfulness mediated the relationship with decreased well-being. Thus, those mentally preoccupied with online communication were overall less satisfied with their lives and reported less affective well-being when they also experienced reduced mindfulness.","2018-11-30","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2020-10-18 17:38:09","2018-12-04 21:24:57","","","","","","Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","liebertpub.com (Atypon)","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite ongoing efforts to diversify such treatments, evidence continues to illuminate modest rates of treatment engagement and perceived barriers to treatment. Patient-centred care (PCC) is one approach that may strengthen the responsiveness of treatments for people with problematic substance use. The aim of this scoping review is to explore how the principles of PCC have been implemented and operationalised in healthcare settings for people with problematic substance use. Methods and analysis This scoping review follows the iterative stages of the Arksey and O’Malley framework. Both empirical (from Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ISI Web of Science) and grey literature references will be considered if they focused on populations with problematic substance use and described or measured PCC or one of its principles in a health-oriented context. Two reviewers will independently screen references in two successive stages of title/abstract screening and then full-text screening for references meeting title/abstract criteria. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. This scoping review has been registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5swvd/). Ethics and dissemination This review will systematically examine the extent and nature of existing evidence of PCC in addiction research and clinical practice. Such evidence will contribute to the operationalisation of PCC for people with problematic substance use. A multidisciplinary team has been gathered to represent the needs of people with problematic substance use, healthcare providers and decision-makers. The team’s knowledge users will be engaged throughout this review and will participate in dissemination activities (eg, workshops, presentations, publications, reports).","2018-12-01","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2019-01-11 19:38:39","e024588","","12","8","","","Patient-centred care for addiction treatment","","","","","","","en","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

We conducted a comprehensive review of psychotherapeutic intervention effects on HPA axis and ANS regulation in adult samples with mental disorders. We searched four databases for psychotherapeutic intervention studies with mentally ill patient samples, assessing cortisol and/or alpha-amylase before and after treatment. Study quality and confounder consideration within biomarker assessment were examined. Twenty-five studies were included. Psychotherapeutic interventions and biomarker assessment methodology varied substantially between studies. Accordingly, meta-analytical computations were deemed unfeasible. Study characteristics especially regarding cortisol and alpha-amylase assessment and analysis procedures were comprehensively reviewed.

In Study 1 (N = 361), I found that environmentally motivated vegetarians resembled animal-motivated vegetarians in construing their diets as a means of achieving more prosocial and moral, but less personal, goals than did health-motivated vegetarians. In Study 2 (N = 562), however, I found that environmentally motivated vegetarians resembled health-motivated vegetarians in reporting less disgust toward meat and lower dietary adherence than did animal-motivated vegetarians. Stronger feelings of disgust toward meat explained why animal-motivated vegetarians exhibited the most stringent dietary adherence.

Self-employed taxpayers who make use of a separate mental account for future income tax payments or collected value added tax (VAT) might find it easier to declare their taxes correctly than taxpayers who do not. This study used a questionnaire to investigate whether self-employed taxpayers (N = 350) use mental accounting to manage their income tax and VAT obligations, whether mental accounting relates to tax knowledge, business and personality characteristics, and to what extent mental accounting is related to intended tax behavior. Our results reveal that some taxpayers mentally segregate taxes from turnover (segregators) while others do not (integrators). We found small differences in mental accounting between income taxes and VAT. Moreover, confirmatory factor analyses suggested that tax knowledge and mental accounting are distinct constructs. Segregation of taxes was related to lower impulsivity and more positive attitudes toward taxation. Individuals who stated they segregate taxes due from turnover more often claimed to run financially prosperous businesses. Mental accounting was not related to intentions of evading taxes, but individuals with higher mental accounting scores reported more pronounced levels of tax planning. While our research design does not allow drawing causal inferences, these findings could suggest that increasing self-employed taxpayers’ ability to organize their financial activities might be a promising strategy to strengthen the competitiveness of their businesses.","2018-12-17","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2019-01-04 21:46:16","","","","","","Journal of Economic Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000","","","","","VAT; income tax; mental accounting; tax; tax compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Observational study. Setting Menu and nutritional information provided by major UK restaurant chains. Main outcome measures Mean energy content of meals, proportion of meals meeting public health recommendations for energy consumption (≤600 kcal), and proportion of meals with excessive energy content (≥1000 kcal). Results Main meals from 27 restaurant chains (21 full service; 6 fast food) were sampled. The mean energy content of all eligible restaurant meals (13 396 in total) was 977 (95% confidence interval 973 to 983) kcal. The percentage of all meals that met public health recommendations for energy content was low (9%; n=1226) and smaller than the percentage of meals with an excessive energy content (47%; 6251). Compared with fast food restaurants, full service restaurants offered significantly more excessively calorific main meals, fewer main meals meeting public health recommendations, and on average 268 (103 to 433) kcal more in main meals. Conclusions The energy content of a large number of main meals in major UK restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations. Although the poor nutritional quality of fast food meals has been well documented, the energy content of full service restaurant meals in the UK tends to be higher and is a cause for concern.

This pre-registered study (https://www.osf.io/9uh6q/) was designed to explore how gestures affect memory for sensorimotor information through the application of the visual-haptic size-weight illusion (i.e., objects weigh the same, but are experienced as different in weight). With this paradigm, a discrepancy can be induced between participants’ conscious illusory perception of objects’ weight and their implicit sensorimotor knowledge (i.e., veridical motor coordination). Depending on whether gestures reflect and strengthen either of these types of knowledge, gestures may respectively decrease or increase the magnitude of the size-weight illusion. Participants (N = 159) practiced a problem-solving task with small and large objects that were designed to induce a size-weight illusion, and then explained the task with or without co-speech gesture or completed a control task. Afterwards, participants judged the heaviness of objects from memory and then while holding them. Confirmatory analyses revealed an inverted size-weight illusion based on heaviness judgments from memory and we found gesturing did not affect judgments. However, exploratory analyses showed reliable correlations between participants’ heaviness judgments from memory and (a) the number of gestures produced that simulated actions, and (b) the kinematics of the lifting phases of those gestures. These findings suggest that gestures emerge as sensorimotor imaginings that are governed by the agent’s conscious renderings about the actions they describe, rather than implicit motor routines.","2018-12-14","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2020-10-18 17:38:08","2019-01-02 22:00:35","","","","","","Psychological Research","Does gesture strengthen sensorimotor knowledge of objects?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","00001  https://osf.io/vn2f3/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that cuteness typically evokes kama muta, a social-relational emotion that in other contexts is often labeled in English as being moved or touched, heartwarming, nostalgia, patriotic feeling, being touched by the Spirit, the feels, etcetera. What evokes kama muta is sudden intensification of a communal sharing relationship, either communal sharing between the person and another, or communal sharing between observed others. In accord with kama muta theory, we hypothesize that a kama muta response to cuteness results from a sudden feeling of communal sharing with the cute target. In colloquial terms, the perceiver adores the cute kittens and their heart goes out to them. When a person perceives cute targets interacting affectionately - that is, intensifying communal sharing between them - this should strengthen a kama muta response. We experimentally investigated these predictions in two studies (N = 356). Study 1 revealed that videos of cute targets evoked significantly more kama muta than videos of targets that were not particularly cute. Study 2, pre-registered, found that, as hypothesized, when cute targets interacted affectionately they evoked more kama muta and were humanized more than when they were not interacting. We measured the level of kama muta by self-reports of sensations and signs and of feelings labelled heartwarming, being moved, and being touched. Participants' ratings of kama muta were positively correlated with reported cuteness. In addition, as in our previous research on kama muta elicited by other types of stimuli, trait empathic concern predicted kama muta responses and perceived cuteness. The studies thus provide first evidence that cute stimuli evoke the heartwarming emotion of kama muta.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2019-02-22 14:56:29","","","","10","","Front.

An empirical investigation of the influence of the double subject fallacy on moral responsibility judgments","Frontiers in Psychology","","1664-1078","10/ggb8kx","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00950/abstract","Despite progress in cognitive neuroscience, we are still far from understanding the relations between the brain and the conscious self. We previously suggested that some neuroscientific texts that attempt to clarify these relations may in fact make them more difficult to understand. Such texts—ranging from popular science to high-impact scientific publications—position the brain and the conscious self as two independent, interacting subjects, capable of possessing opposite psychological states. We termed such writing ‘Double Subject Fallacy’ (DSF). We further suggested that such DSF language, besides being conceptually confusing and reflecting dualistic intuitions, might affect people’s conceptions of moral responsibility, lessening the perception of guilt over actions. Here, we empirically investigated this proposition with a series of three experiments (pilot and two preregistered replications), all 3x2 between-subjects design. Subjects were presented with moral scenarios where the defendant was either (1) clearly guilty, (2) ambiguous, or (3) clearly innocent while the accompanying neuroscientific evidence about the defendant was presented using DSF or non-DSF language. Subjects were instructed to rate the defendant’s guilt in all experiments. Subjects rated the defendant in the clearly guilty scenario as guiltier than in the two other scenarios and the defendant in the ambiguously described scenario as guiltier than in the innocent scenario, as expected. In Experiment 1 (N=609), an effect was further found for DSF language in the expected direction: subjects rated the defendant less guilty when the neuroscientific evidence was described using DSF language, across all levels of culpability. However, this effect did not replicate in Experiment 2 (N=1794), which focused on different moral scenario, nor in Experiment 3 (N=1810), which was an exact replication of Experiment 1. Bayesian analyses yielded strong evidence against the existence of an effect of DSF language on the perception of guilt. Our results thus challenge the claim that DSF language affects subjects’ moral judgements. They further demonstrate the importance of good scientific practice, including preregistration and—most critically—replication, to avoid reaching erroneous conclusions based on false-positive results.","2019","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2019-04-16 15:15:55","","","","10","","Front.

Previous research suggests that eveningness prospectively predicts depression in adolescence. Anxiety often co-occurs with depression, but little is known about longitudinal, reciprocal associations between chronotype and anxiety, and whether this relationship remains after controlling for depression. We assessed different forms of anxiety (social, panic, separation), positive/negative affect, anxious arousal (from tripartite theory), and depression, in relation to chronotype to better understand the specificity and directionality of associations between chronotype and internalizing problems in adolescence. Community youth participated in three assessment time points: T1, T2 (18-months post-T1), and T3 (30-months post-T1) as part of a larger longitudinal study. Youth completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and chronotype. Regression analyses showed that eveningness: (1) concurrently associated with decreased separation anxiety, elevated symptoms of depression and low levels of positive affect, (2) was prospectively predicted by elevated depression, (3) did not predict later symptoms of anxiety.

Participants (total N = 72) were presented with colored real-life objects and were asked to recall the colors using a continuous color wheel. Deviations from study colors were modeled to generate two estimates of color memory: the variability of remembered colors—fidelity—and the probability of forgetting the color. Estimating model parameters using both maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found that working memory had better fidelity than long-term memory (Experiments 1 and 2). Furthermore, within each system, fidelity worsened as a function of time-correlated mechanisms (Experiments 2 and 3). We conclude that fidelity is subject to decline across and within memory systems.

Various open source health information technologies (OS-HITs) are continuously being designed and developed for different areas of healthcare to increase organisational efficiencies and quality of care at minimum costs. The objective of this scoping review is to identify the kinds of existing OS-HITs, their characteristics (e.g. functions) and capabilities (e.g. advantages/disadvantages) for various healthcare stakeholders (physicians and patients) and healthcare sectors (e.g. clinical, administrative).METHODS: We will conduct a scoping review to identify the range of available OS-HITs in international literature from 1980 to September 2018. Searches will be conducted in six major international databases, namely: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Excerpta Medica Database, Global Health, Library Information Science and Technology Abstracts, Medline and Web of Science to identify relevant published research. We will also search the Google search engine and Google Scholar for on-going and unpublished work and the grey literature. Searches will be peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers and will not be limited by methodology or language. Next, selected references will be tabulated for study characteristics by author affiliation, country of origin, the name of OS-HIT, healthcare area/sector, system requirements, stakeholders, complete solution and web link. Furthermore, functions, benefits/advantages, disadvantages and outcomes (e.g. usability) of OS-HITs will be extracted. Narrative and interpretative synthesis of data will be undertaken.RESULTS: We will report our findings in a peer-reviewed journal.","2018-12-31","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2020-10-18 17:38:07","2019-01-14 19:00:19","230-238","","4","25","","","The characteristics and capabilities of the available open source health information technologies supporting healthcare","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2019 Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics","","","","hijournal.bcs.org","","00001  https://osf.io/rj8av/","","","","","scoping review; health information technology; open source","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This tool is intended to improve the quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness of prescribing. Objective: We aimed to measure the impact of OpenPrescribing being viewed on subsequent prescribing. Methods: Having preregistered our protocol and code, we measured three different metrics of prescribing quality (mean percentile across 34 existing OpenPrescribing quality measures, available “price-per-unit” savings, and total “low-priority prescribing” spend) to see whether they changed after the viewing of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and practice pages. We also measured whether practices whose data were viewed on OpenPrescribing differed in prescribing, prior to viewing, compared with those who were not. We used fixed-effects and between-effects linear panel regression to isolate change over time and differences between practices, respectively. We adjusted for the month of prescribing in the fixed-effects model to remove underlying trends in outcome measures. Results: We found a reduction in available price-per-unit savings for both practices and CCGs after their pages were viewed. The saving was greater at practice level (−£40.42 per thousand patients per month; 95% CI −54.04 to −26.81) than at CCG level (−£14.70 per thousand patients per month; 95% CI −25.56 to −3.84). We estimate a total saving since launch of £243 thosand at practice level and £1.47 million at CCG level between the feature launch and end of follow-up (August to November 2017) among practices viewed. If the observed savings from practices viewed were extrapolated to all practices, this would generate £26.8 million in annual savings for the NHS, approximately 20% of the total possible savings from this method. The other two measures were not different after CCGs or practices were viewed. Practices that were viewed had worse prescribing quality scores overall prior to viewing. Conclusions: We found a positive impact from the use of OpenPrescribing, specifically for the class of savings opportunities that can only be identified by using this tool. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to conduct a robust analysis of the impact of such a Web-based service on clinical practice.

Subsequently, participants recalled an autobiographical event where they had felt grateful or happy, followed by a post-induction flanker task. Despite closely following existing protocols, participants in the gratitude condition did not report elevated gratefulness compared to the happy group. In regard to self-control, we found no association between gratitude—operationalized by experimental condition or as a continuous predictor—and any control metric, including flanker interference, post-error adjustments, or neural monitoring (the error-related negativity, ERN).

This converged naming pattern differs from the monolingual naming patterns of both a bilingual’s languages. We conducted a pre-registered replication study of experiments addressing the question whether there is a convergence between a bilingual’s both lexicons. The replication used an enlarged set of stimuli of common household containers, providing generalizability and more reliable representations of the semantic domain. Both an analysis at the group-level and at the individual level of the correlations between naming patterns reject the two-pattern hypothesis that poses that bilinguals use two monolingual-like naming patterns, one for each of their two languages. However, the results of the original study and the replication comply with the one-pattern hypothesis, which poses that bilinguals converge the naming patterns of their two languages and form a compromise. Since this convergence is only partial the naming pattern in bilinguals corresponds to a moderate version of the one-pattern hypothesis. These findings are further confirmed by a representation of the semantic domain in a multidimensional space and the finding of shorter distances between bilingual category centers than monolingual category centers in this multidimensional space both in the original and in the replication study.","2016","2020-10-18 17:39:00","2020-10-18 17:39:00","2017-01-17 18:29:29","","","","7","","Front.

Two studies showed that hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies—Belief in a Just World, Social Dominance Orientation, and political conservatism—predict lower obligation judgments. One study showed that hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies predicted greater protection of a potential discriminator; in another, they also predicted lower protection of a person who may be discriminated against. Lastly, one study showed that greater obligation judgments predicted greater blame of a person who discriminated based on implicit bias. Taken together, these four studies address how people’s ideologies relate to their obligation judgments for implicit racial bias and how those obligation judgments are related to blame for discrimination resulting from implicit racial bias.","2016-02-25","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2016-08-31 17:04:39","159-185","","2","29","","Soc Just Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/zj8an/%3fview_only%3d14a60e3fb95d4c009660fca33968262c","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\KXGZVIR4\10.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether a similar action–omission effect applies to judgments of praiseworthiness of positive outcomes is still an open question. Drawing on positive–negative asymmetries found in other domains, we hypothesized that positive events would not elicit an action–omission effect for judgments of praise, because such positive events do not by default trigger the causal appraisal processes that are central to the action–omission effect. Furthermore, we posited that when people are explicitly asked to consider causality before or during the judgment, an action–omission effect on judgments of praise could be obtained too. These hypotheses were verified in three independent studies and a meta-analytic analysis. As such, the present set of studies provides novel insights in the action–omission effect's asymmetry for negative and positive outcomes, as well as an increased understanding of the role of causality appraisal in this effect: judgments of praise are less reliant on causal reasoning than judgments of blame, and therefore also less susceptible to the action–omission bias.","2016-03","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2015-12-08 19:35:58","19-25","","","63","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","The morality of action","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: bostyn_morality_2016-2 00000","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\H4H78NVK\S0022103115300172.html","","","Action effect; Casual appraisal; Moral cognition; Omission-bias; Praise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on design thinking, the present research formalizes a methodology for redesigning and tailoring initial interventions. We test the methodology using the case of fixed versus growth mindsets during the transition to high school. Qualitative inquiry and rapid, iterative, randomized “A/B” experiments were conducted with ~3,000 participants to inform intervention revisions for this population. Next, two experimental evaluations showed that the revised growth mindset intervention was an improvement over previous versions in terms of short-term proxy outcomes (Study 1, N=7,501), and it improved 9th grade core-course GPA and reduced D/F GPAs for lower achieving students when delivered via the Internet under routine conditions with ~95% of students at 10 schools (Study 2, N=3,676). Although the intervention could still be improved even further, the current research provides a model for how to improve and scale interventions that begin to address pressing educational problems. It also provides insight into how to teach a growth mindset more effectively.","2016-04","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2017-02-13 14:49:38","374-391","","3","108","","J Educ Psychol","Using Design Thinking to Improve Psychological Interventions","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","osf.io/aerpt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, considerable debate exists among researchers as to the nature of the ego-depletion effect, and growing evidence suggests the effect may not be as strong or robust as the extant literature suggests. We examined the robustness of the ego-depletion effect and aimed to maximize the likelihood of detecting the effect by using one of the most widely used depletion tasks (video-viewing attention control task) and by considering task characteristics and individual differences that potentially moderate the effect. We also sought to make our research plan transparent by pre-registering our hypotheses, procedure, and planned analyses prior to data collection. Contrary to the ego-depletion hypothesis, participants in the depletion condition did not perform worse than control participants on the subsequent self-control task, even after considering moderator variables. These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting ego-depletion is not a reliable phenomenon, though more research is needed that uses large sample sizes, considers moderator variables, and pre-registers prior to data collection.","2016-02-10","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2020-10-18 17:38:59","2016-08-31 16:59:44","e0147770","","2","11","","PLOS ONE","No Evidence of the Ego-Depletion Effect across Task Characteristics and Individual Differences","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Citation Key: lurquin_no_2016 https://osf.io/cifn3/?view_only=0c7de573120f4cab9b52e7ec2b2acd2d","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\53G45BFC\article.html","","","Attention; meta-analysis; Psychology; memory; Decision making; Research validity; Statistical data; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eskine reported that participants exposed to organic food became much more morally judgmental and much less prosocial relative to participants exposed to neutral or comfort foods. This research sparked tremendous media interest, but was based on one experiment with a small sample size. We report three attempts to replicate Eskine using samples conferring high power, preregistered analysis plans, and original materials. Across two direct replications and an online conceptual replication, we found that organic food exposure has little to no effect on moral judgments (d = 0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.14, 0.26], N = 377) and prosocial behavior (d = 0.03, 95% CI [−0.17, 0.23], N = 377). Mere exposure to organic food is probably not sufficient to substantially change moral behavior.","2016-05-01","2020-10-18 17:38:58","2020-10-18 17:38:58","2016-08-31 17:02:57","312-319","","4","7","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","spp.sagepub.com","","https://osf.io/atkn7/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\2PI2WSZZ\312.html","","","morality; Embodied cognition; moral licensing; organic food; prosociality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that older adults were more concerned about video games as an abstract concept but when exposed to a particular video game, even an M-rated violent game, expressed fewer concerns about that specific video game. Results support the hypothesis that negative attitudes toward video games exists mainly in the abstract and do not survive direct exposure to individual games. Further, older adults were not uniform in their condemnation of video games with older adults having varying opinions about the harmfulness of video games.

Human Perception and Performance","","1939-1277","10/f8fn3h","","We often fail to detect clearly visible, yet unexpected objects when our attention is otherwise engaged, a phenomenon widely known as inattentional blindness. The potentially devastating consequences and the mediators of such failures of awareness have been studied extensively. Surprisingly, however, hardly anything is known about whether and how we process the objects that go unnoticed during inattentional blindness. In 2 experiments, we demonstrate that the meaning of objects undetected due to inattentional blindness interferes with the classification of attended stimuli. Responses were significantly slower when the semantic content of an undetected stimulus contradicted that of the attended, to-be-judged object. We thus clarify the depth of the ""blindness"" caused by inattention, as we provide compelling evidence that failing to detect the unexpected does not preclude its processing, even at postperceptual stages. Despite inattentional blindness, our mind obviously still has access to something as refined as meaning.

One potential solution is to add gamelike elements to these tasks in order to make them more intrinsically enjoyable, and some researchers have posited that a more engaging task might produce higher quality data. This assumption, however, remains largely untested. We investigated the effects of gamelike features and test location on the data and enjoyment ratings from a simple cognitive task. We tested three gamified variants of the Go-No-Go task, delivered both in the laboratory and online. In the first version of the task participants were rewarded with points for performing optimally. The second version of the task was framed as a cowboy shootout. The third version was a standard Go-No-Go task, used as a control condition. We compared reaction time, accuracy and subjective measures of enjoyment and engagement between task variants and study location. We found points to be a highly suitable game mechanic for gamified cognitive testing because they did not disrupt the validity of the data collected but increased participant enjoyment. However, we found no evidence that gamelike features could increase engagement to the point where participant performance improved. We also found that while participants enjoyed the cowboy themed task, the difficulty of categorising the gamelike stimuli adversely affected participant performance, increasing No-Go error rates by 28% compared to the non-game control. Responses collected online vs. in the laboratory had slightly longer reaction times but were otherwise very similar, supporting other findings that online crowdsourcing is an acceptable method of data collection for this type of research.","2016-07-06","2020-10-18 17:38:58","2020-10-18 17:38:58","2016-08-31 15:44:13","e2184","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","https://osf.io/va547/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\ZQ3DNHDM\2184.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the association between income and sadness could not be explained by demographics, stress, or daily time use. Extending Kushlev et al.’s findings, new analyses indicated that only between-persons variance in income (but not within-persons variance) predicted daily sadness—perhaps because there was relatively little within-persons variance in income. Finally, income predicted less daily sadness and worry, but not less anger or frustration—potentially suggesting that income predicts less “internalizing” but not less “externalizing” negative emotions.

METHODS: We combined individual participant data from 13 prospective cohorts at marine and freshwater beaches throughout the United States (n = 84 411). We measured incident outcomes within 10 days of exposure: diarrhea, gastrointestinal illness, missed daily activity (work, school, vacation), and medical visits. We estimated the relationship between outcomes and 2 exposures: body immersion swimming and Enterococcus spp. fecal indicator bacteria levels in the water. We also estimated the population-attributable risk associated with these exposures. RESULTS: Water exposure accounted for 21% of diarrhea episodes and 9% of missed daily activities but was unassociated with gastroenteritis leading to medical consultation. Children aged 0 to 4 and 5 to 10 years had the most water exposure, exhibited stronger associations between levels of water quality and illness, and accounted for the largest attributable illness burden. CONCLUSIONS: The higher gastroenteritis risk and associated burden in young children presents important new information to inform future recreational water quality guidelines designed to protect public health.","2016-09","2020-10-18 17:38:57","2020-10-18 17:38:57","","1690-1697","","9","106","","Am J Public Health","Acute Gastroenteritis and Recreational Water","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","https://osf.io/i3742","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459461","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We carried out a direct replication of their behavioural study and did not replicate their finding that memory performance associated with reward follows this pattern of adaptive scaling. An effect of reward outcome was in the opposite direction to the original study, with lower reward outcomes leading to better memory than higher outcomes.

In Studies 2 and 3, lower class individuals were more prosocial in a dictator game scenario in private than in public, whereas upper class individuals showed the reverse pattern. Follow-up analyses revealed the importance of reputational concerns for shaping class differences in prosociality: Specifically, higher class individuals reported that pride motivated their prosocial behavior more than lower class individuals, and this association partially accounted for class-based differences in prosociality in public versus private contexts.

Typically, correcting affective forecasts to include more relevant information improves their accuracy by reducing their extremity. In contrast, we found that providing affective forecasters with social-category information about their targets made their forecasts more extreme and therefore less accurate. In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers’ responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets.

Monitoring data were also used from the national behavioural support programme; during the study, 8 029 012 quit dates were set with this programme. Setting England. Main outcome measures Prevalence of e-cigarette use in current smokers and during a quit attempt were used to predict quit success. Prevalence of e-cigarette use in current smokers was used to predict rate of quit attempts. Percentage of quit attempts involving e-cigarette use was also used to predict quit attempts involving use of prescription treatments, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on prescription and bought over the counter, and use of behavioural support. Analyses involved adjustment for a range of potential confounders. Results The success rate of quit attempts increased by 0.098% (95% confidence interval 0.064 to 0.132; P<0.001) and 0.058% (0.038 to 0.078; P<0.001) for every 1% increase in the prevalence of e-cigarette use by smokers and e-cigarette use during a recent quit attempt, respectively. There was no clear evidence for an association between e-cigarette use and rate of quit attempts (β 0.025; 95% confidence interval −0.035 to 0.085; P=0.41), use of NRT bought over the counter (β 0.006; −0.088 to 0.077; P=0.89), use of prescription treatment (β −0.070; −0.152 to 0.013; P=0.10), or use of behavioural support (β −0.013; −0.102 to 0.077; P=0.78). A negative association was found between e-cigarette use during a recent quit attempt and use of NRT obtained on prescription (β −0.098; −0.189 to −0.007; P=0.04). Conclusion Changes in prevalence of e-cigarette use in England have been positively associated with the success rates of quit attempts. No clear association has been found between e-cigarette use and the rate of quit attempts or the use of other quitting aids, except for NRT obtained on prescription, where the association has been negative.

However, the benefit has sometimes been attenuated with more complex materials that require integrating multiple units of information. Critically, Tran et al. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 22, 135–140 (2015) found that retrieval practice improves sentence memory but not the drawing of inferences from the same sentences. In three experiments, we investigated whether this lack of benefit of retrieval practice for inferential ability was due to the presentation format of the material. Participants studied four sets of seven to nine related sentences by practicing retrieval for two sets and rereading the other two sets. A final test was given 2 days later. When sentences were presented one at a time during study/practice as in Tran et al., we found no effect of retrieval practice on a test requiring inferential reasoning. When sentences in a set were presented simultaneously during study/practice, retrieval practice in the form of fill-in-the-blank testing (experiments 1 and 2) and free recall (experiment 3) aided later deductive inference more than rereading. Our findings suggest that retrieval practice can improve deductive inference, but in order to optimize its utility, the format in which the material is presented during practice must not hinder relational processing of the individual sentences.","2016-09-15","2020-10-18 17:38:57","2020-10-18 17:38:57","2016-09-20 13:15:05","1-14","","","","","Educ Psychol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","www.osf.io/8ay9f","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\DEMMVR97\s10648-016-9386-y.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (N = 386) were randomly assigned to play a VVG or a NVG prior to presumably interacting with another (non-existent) participant. We then measured participants' aggressive inclinations: Participants reported how many pins they would like to stick into a “voodoo doll” representing their interaction partner, and participants reported how likely they would be to actually harm their interaction partner. We did not detect any differences between conditions for several outcomes: the amount of aggressive inclinations displayed during the interaction, the number of pins participants chose to stick into a representation of their interaction partner, and participants' self-reported likelihood they would harm their interaction partner. Thus, the hypothesis that playing a VVG would increase aggressive inclinations was not supported in this study. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between (1) participants' self-reported likelihood to aggress and perceptions of the game as frustrating or difficult, (2) gender and higher levels of pin selection, and (3) participants' self-identification as a gamer and lower levels of pin selection.","2016-11","2020-10-18 17:38:46","2020-10-18 17:38:46","2016-09-22 14:34:05","13-19","","","67","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Does playing video games with violent content temporarily increase aggressive inclinations?","Special Issue: Confirmatory","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: mccarthy_does_2016 https://osf.io/2y638/?view_only=6678d630023a48028e8e41566a178776","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\QMDWNVBF\S0022103115300093.html","","","Aggression; Video games; General Aggression Model; Media violence; Violent video games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The present study tested the pre-registered hypothesis that self-affirmation increases intentions to change health-relevant behaviors among participants with relatively high health risks as a result of broadening their temporal perspectives. Among participants with relatively high health risks, self-affirmation indeed led to greater general intentions to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, but not specific consumption intentions. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of the self-affirmation manipulation on temporal perspective, as assessed by a monetary delay discounting task.

Recognition memory performance exceeded change detection performance, even when a single familiar object in the postchange display consistently indicated the change location. In fact, participants were no better when a familiar object predicted the change location than when the displays consisted of unfamiliar objects. When given an explicit strategy to search for a familiar object as a way to improve performance on the change detection task, they performed no better than in a 6-alternative recognition memory task. Subjects only benefited from the presence of familiar objects in the change detection task when they had more time to view the prechange array before it switched.

Methods and analysis We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for scoping reviews. Literature searches of electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ERIC, PsycINFO) will be conducted from inception onwards. The electronic search will be supplemented by searching for sources that index unpublished/difficult to locate studies (eg, GreyNet International database), as well as through scanning of reference lists of reviews on related topics. All study designs using either qualitative or quantitative methodologies will be eligible if there is a description of the strategies, barriers or facilitators, and outcomes of engaging policymakers, healthcare managers and policy analysts in the knowledge synthesis process. Screening and data abstraction will be conducted by 2 team members independently after a calibration exercise across the team. A third team member will resolve all discrepancies.

Consistent with the propositional account, Experiment 1 showed that avoidance instructions had a negative effect on implicit evaluations over and above the positive effect of approach instructions. Consistent with the associative self-anchoring account, Experiment 2 showed that changes in implicit self-stimulus linking mediated AA instruction effects on implicit evaluations. However, mediation was only partial, in that AA instructions showed a significant effect on implicit evaluations after controlling for implicit self-stimulus linking.

Recent advances in research on the connection between self-control and moral behavior indicate that low self-control is associated with increased dishonesty. From an evolutionary perspective, when mating motivation is activated, men may behave in dishonest ways by projecting characteristics in line with women's mate preferences to enhance their sexual attractiveness. We tested the possibility that exposure to pictures of sexually appealing women would engender lower self-control, leading men to behave dishonestly. The results showed that a state of lower self-control was observed in males who viewed sexy women but not in males who viewed unsexy women or in females who viewed men (Experiment 1). Compared with control participants, male participants exposed to pictures of sexy women were less likely to return excess money received for participating (Experiment 2) and more likely to cheat in a matrix task (Experiments 3 and 4). State self-control mediated the link between exposure to sexual stimuli and dishonest behavior in men (Experiments 2 and 4).The present findings suggest that ubiquitous sexual stimuli in daily life may be more closely associated with men's morally questionable behavior such as dishonesty or cheating than previously thought. For men whose mating motivation is heightened by exposure to sexual stimuli, dishonesty appears to be a tactic for projecting characteristics preferred by women (e.g., large economic resources).","2017","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2017-02-07 14:19:16","","","","","","Evolution and Human Behavior","Sexy women can tempt men down the road of immorality","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/xpgfq/","","","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816302884","","self-control; Mate attraction; Mating motivation; Men's dishonesty; Sexual stimuli","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing the role of inhibition capacity in the no-go devaluation effect","Appetite","","0195-6663","10/gdbtrf","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317301642","Not responding to food items in a go/no-go task can lead to devaluation of these food items, which may help people regulate their eating behavior. The Behavior Stimulus Interaction (BSI) theory explains this devaluation effect by assuming that inhibiting impulses triggered by appetitive foods elicits negative affect, which in turn devalues the food items. BSI theory further predicts that the devaluation effect will be stronger when food items are more appetitive and when individuals have low inhibition capacity. To test these hypotheses, we manipulated the appetitiveness of food items and measured individual inhibition capacity with the stop-signal task. Food items were consistently paired with either go or no-go cues, so that participants responded to go items and not to no-go items. Evaluations of these items were measured before and after go/no-go training. Across two preregistered experiments, we consistently found no-go foods were liked less after the training compared to both go foods and foods not used in the training. Unexpectedly, this devaluation effect occurred for both appetitive and less appetitive food items. Exploratory signal detection analyses suggest this latter finding might be explained by increased learning of stimulus-response contingencies for the less appetitive items when they are presented among appetitive items. Furthermore, the strength of devaluation did not consistently correlate with individual inhibition capacity, and Bayesian analyses combining data from both experiments provided moderate support for the null hypothesis. The current project demonstrated the devaluation effect induced by the go/no-go training, but failed to obtain further evidence for BSI theory. Since the devaluation effect was reliably obtained across experiments, the results do reinforce the notion that the go/no-go training is a promising tool to help people regulate their eating behavior.","2017","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2017-05-01 13:28:29","","","","","","Appetite","Do impulsive individuals benefit more from food go/no-go training?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/cz8zr/","","","","","Impulsivity; Food; Response inhibition; Devaluation; Go/no-go task; Stop-signal paradigm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ‘bogus’ taste test is a measure widely used in eating behaviour research to identify factors that may have a causal effect on food intake. However, there has been no examination of the validity of the bogus taste test as a measure of food intake. We conducted a participant level analysis of 31 published laboratory studies that used the taste test to measure food intake. We assessed whether the taste test was sensitive to experimental manipulations hypothesized to increase or decrease food intake. We examined construct validity by testing whether participant sex, hunger and liking of taste test food were associated with the amount of food consumed in the taste test. In addition, we also examined whether BMI (body mass index), trait measures of dietary restraint and over-eating in response to palatable food cues were associated with food consumption. Results indicated that the taste test was sensitive to experimental manipulations hypothesized to increase or decrease food intake. Factors that were reliably associated with increased consumption during the taste test were being male, have a higher baseline hunger, liking of the taste test food and a greater tendency to overeat in response to palatable food cues, whereas trait dietary restraint and BMI were not. These results indicate that the bogus taste test is likely to be a valid measure of food intake and can be used to identify factors that have a causal effect on food intake.","2017","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2017-05-09 13:34:48","","","","","","Appetite","The bogus taste test","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/zd9sd/?show=view","","","","","Appetite; Food intake; Eating behaviour; Laboratory; Taste test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 46 countries, we explored the cross-country relationships between average life expectancy, intertemporal choice, and women's age at first birth. We find that, across countries, lower life expectancy is associated with both a smaller percentage of people willing to wait for a larger but delayed reward, as well as a younger age at first birth.

However, such repeated testing regimes place a considerable burden on participants, and with cognitive tasks typically being regarded as effortful and unengaging, these studies may experience high levels of participant attrition. One potential solution is to gamify these tasks to make them more engaging: increasing participant willingness to take part and reducing attrition. However, such an approach must balance task validity with the introduction of entertaining gamelike elements. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effects of gamelike features on participant attrition using a between-subjects, longitudinal Web-based testing study. Methods: We used three variants of a common cognitive task, the Stop Signal Task (SST), with a single gamelike feature in each: one variant where points were rewarded for performing optimally; another where the task was given a graphical theme; and a third variant, which was a standard SST and served as a control condition. Participants completed four compulsory test sessions over 4 consecutive days before entering a 6-day voluntary testing period where they faced a daily decision to either drop out or continue taking part. Participants were paid for each session they completed. Results: A total of 482 participants signed up to take part in the study, with 265 completing the requisite four consecutive test sessions. No evidence of an effect of gamification on attrition was observed. A log-rank test showed no evidence of a difference in dropout rates between task variants (χ22=3.0, P=.22), and a one-way analysis of variance of the mean number of sessions completed per participant in each variant also showed no evidence of a difference (F2,262=1.534, P=.21, partial η2=0.012). Conclusions: Our findings raise doubts about the ability of gamification to reduce attrition from longitudinal cognitive testing studies.

However, thus far most findings were based on controlled clinical trials that may only poorly represent real-world clinical settings due to highly selective samples mostly restricted to patients with major depression undergoing anti-depressive medication. Focusing on personality and psychopathology in a representative naturalistic sample of psychotherapy patients is therefore worthwhile. Moreover, up to date hardly any confirmatory research has been conducted in this field. Strictly confirmatory research implies two major requirements: firstly, specific hypotheses, including expected effect sizes and statistical approaches to data analysis, must be detailed prior to inspection of the data, and secondly, corresponding protocols have to be published online and freely available. Here we introduce a longitudinal naturalistic study aimed at examining, firstly, the prospective impact of baseline personality traits on the outcome of psychotherapy over a 6-month observation period, secondly, the stability and change in personality traits over time, thirdly, the association between longitudinal change in psychopathology and personality, fourthly, the agreement between self-reports and informant-rating of personality, and fifthly, the predictive validity of personality self-reports compared to corresponding informant-ratings. For it we comprehensively state a-priori hypotheses, predict the expected effect sizes and detail the statistical analyses that we intend to conduct to test these predictions. Such a stringent confirmatory design increases the transparency and objectivity of psychopathological research, which is necessary to reduce the rate of false-positive findings and to increase the yield of scientific research.","2017","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2020-10-18 17:38:45","2017-02-07 14:40:56","","","","8","","Front.

Both open-minded and caring are generally seen as positive attributes. However, consistency varies—the attribute caring is consistent with the midwife stereotype while open-minded is not. In general, both stimulus valence and consistency can influence evaluations. Six experiments investigated the respective influence of valence and consistency on evaluative judgments in the domain of stereotyping. In an impression formation paradigm, valence and consistency of stereotypic information about target persons were manipulated orthogonally and spontaneous evaluations of these target persons were measured. Valence reliably influenced evaluations. However, for strongly valenced stereotypes, no effect of consistency was observed. Parameters possibly preventing the occurrence of consistency effects were ruled out, specifically, valence of inconsistent attributes, processing priority of category information, and impression formation instructions. However, consistency had subtle effects on evaluative judgments if the information about a target person was not strongly valenced and experimental conditions were optimal. Concluding, in principle, both stereotype valence and consistency can play a role in evaluative judgments of stereotypic target persons. However, the more subtle influence of consistency does not seem to substantially influence evaluations of stereotyped target persons. Implications for fluency research and stereotype disconfirmation are discussed.","2017","2020-10-18 17:38:44","2020-10-18 17:38:44","2017-10-17 18:34:43","","","","8","","Front.

The effect sizes selected and obtained by high-expertise replication teams was nearly twice as large as that obtained by low-expertise teams, particularly in replications of social psychology effects. Surprisingly, this effect seemed to be explained by experts choosing studies to replicate that had larger original effect sizes. There was little evidence that expertise predicted avoiding red flags (i.e. the troubling trio) or studies that varied in execution difficulty.

A systematic review of published data from 37 studies worldwide (including Canada) found the median under-reporting rate of adverse events to be 94% in spontaneous reporting systems. This scoping review aims to assess the utility of social media and crowd-sourced data to detect and monitor adverse events related to health products including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biologics and natural health products. Methods and analysis Our review conduct will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception to 13 May 2016. Additional sources included searches of study registries, conference abstracts, dissertations, as well as websites of international regulatory authorities (eg, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the WHO, European Medicines Agency). Search results will be supplemented by scanning the references of relevant reviews. We will include all publication types including published articles, editorials, websites and book sections that describe use of social media and crowd-sourced data for surveillance of adverse events associated with health products. Two reviewers will perform study selection and data abstraction independently, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. Data analysis will involve quantitative (eg, frequencies) and qualitative (eg, content analysis) methods. Dissemination The summary of results will be sent to Health Canada, who commissioned the review, and other relevant policymakers involved with the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network. We will compile and circulate a 1-page policy brief and host a 1-day stakeholder meeting to discuss the implications, key messages and finalise the knowledge translation strategy. Findings from this review will ultimately inform the design and development of a data analytics platform for social media and crowd-sourced data for pharmacovigilance in Canada and internationally.

The current study tests whether strength-based parenting, in conjunction with a teenager’s strengths use, influences the teenager’s subjective wellbeing, and whether a growth mindset moderates the relationship between strength-based parenting and strengths use. Three hundred and sixty three adolescents (Mage = 13.74, 51% female) completed questionnaire measures of strength-based parenting, strengths use, subjective wellbeing (life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect), Extraversion, Neuroticism, and two aspects of growth mindset. A hierarchical regression using latent variables found that strengths use and strength-based parenting were both significant independent predictors of subjective wellbeing, over and above the effects of extraversion and neuroticism. A mediation analysis found that strengths use partially mediated the relationship between strength-based parenting and subjective wellbeing. Finally, a novel measure of strengths mindset significantly moderated the relationship between strength-based parenting and strengths use. These results suggest that adolescents who see their parents as strength-based report greater strengths use (especially when they have a growth mindset about their strengths) and greater subjective wellbeing.","2017-01-17","2020-10-18 17:38:43","2020-10-18 17:38:43","2017-01-23 14:32:58","1-20","","","","","J Happiness Stud","Strengths and Subjective Wellbeing in Adolescence","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/w5u9f/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\VGWMSM8E\s10902-016-9841-y.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We regenerated cells stably expressing ectopic wild-type and mutant phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) using the same immortalized human NRASG12D melanocytes as the original study. Evaluation of PREX2 expression in these newly generated stable cells revealed varying levels of expression among the PREX2 isoforms, which was also observed in the stable cells made in the original study (Figure S6A; Berger et al., 2012). Additionally, ectopically expressed PREX2 was found to be at least 5 times above endogenous PREX2 expression. The monitoring of tumor formation of these stable cells in vivo resulted in no statistically significant difference in tumor-free survival driven by PREX2 variants, whereas the original study reported that these PREX2 mutations increased the rate of tumor incidence compared to controls (Figure 3B and S6B; Berger et al., 2012). Surprisingly, the median tumor-free survival was 1 week in this replication attempt, while 70% of the control mice were reported to be tumor-free after 9 weeks in the original study. The rapid tumor onset observed in this replication attempt, compared to the original study, makes the detection of accelerated tumor growth in PREX2 expressing NRASG12D melanocytes extremely difficult.

However, our efforts to replicate this experiment were confounded because spontaneous regression of tumors occurred in several of the mice. Additionally, the excised tumors were scored for inflammatory cell infiltrates.

Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011).

The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on MYC transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1.

Whether screening is helpful in secondary care is unclear. This prospective cohort study in adults with LBP placed on outpatient clinic waiting lists, compared the performance of the short-form Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (OMPSQ), the PICKUP Tool (PICKUP) and the STarT Back Tool (SBT). We assessed predictive validity for outcome at 4-month follow-up, by calculating estimates of discrimination, calibration and overall performance. We applied a decision curve analysis (DCA) approach to describe the clinical value of screening in this setting via comparison with a ‘treat-all’ strategy. Complete data were available for 89% of enrolled participants (n=195). 84% reported ‘poor outcome’ at follow-up. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval) was 0.66(0.54-0.78) for the OMPSQ; 0.61(0.49–0.73) for the PICKUP and 0.69(0.51–0.80) for the SBT. All instruments were miscalibrated and underestimated risk. DCA indicated that, in this setting, prognostic screening does not add value over and above a treat-all approach. The potential for LBP patients to be misclassified by screening and the high incidence of non-recovery indicate that care decisions should be made with the assumption that all patients are ‘at risk’. Perspective This article presents a head-to-head comparison of three low back pain screening instruments in a secondary care setting. Early patient screening is likely to hold little clinical value in this setting and care pathways that consider all patients at risk of a poor outcome are suggested to be most appropriate.","2017-01-30","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2017-02-06 18:42:30","","","0","0","","The Journal of Pain","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jpain.org","","https://osf.io/ctyed/","","","","","Low back pain; predictive validity; prognostic screening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These results provide strong evidence that making use of stored visual knowledge—long-term memory of what things look like—depends on perceptual mechanisms. In the first set of studies, we show that presenting visual noise patterns during or after hearing a verbal cue greatly reduces the effectiveness of the cue on a simple visual discrimination task. In the second experiment, participants were tasked with answering questions about visual features of familiar objects, e.g., verifying that tables have flat surfaces. Accuracy in answering visual, but not encyclopedic questions was reduced when viewing colorful noise patterns. This result is most parsimoniously explained by positing that judgments required activation of visual representations that were being interfered with when viewing irrelevant patterns. Although much of our conceptual knowledge may abstract away from perceptual details, knowledge of what things look like appears to be represented in a visual format.","2017-02","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2016-08-31 15:56:47","281-292","","","92","","Journal of Memory and Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","osf.io/9dy87 osf.io/s64ik","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\6VC948PA\S0749596X16300614.html","","","Concepts; Representations; Visual knowledge; Visual long-term memory; Word-recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although participants selectively avoided more costly missiles when playing, they were no more likely to notice an unexpected object when its color was associated with greater costs.

Many substandard Belgian Dutch varieties, however, still mark this distinction, making them more akin to German than Standard Dutch in this respect. Seventy-one Belgian and 104 Netherlandic speakers of Dutch with varying levels of German proficiency assigned gender-marked German articles to German nouns with Dutch cognates; these gender assignments were then compared to the cognates’ gender in the standard and substandard L1 varieties. While the gender assignments of both Belgian and Dutch participants were strongly influenced by the cognates’ Standard Dutch gender, the Belgians’ responses showed, at best, weak traces of the masculine–feminine distinction in substandard Belgian Dutch.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) until recently recommended a relatively restrictive screen time diet of 2 h or less for most youth. A representative correlational sample of youth were assessed for links between screen time and risky behavioral outcomes. Data collection occurred in 2013 conducted by the State of Florida. Use of screens that was moderately high, in excess of the AAP’s former recommendations, but not excessive (1 SD or higher than average), was not associated with delinquency, risky behaviors, sexual behaviors, substance abuse, reduced grades or mental health problems. Even excessive screen use (1 SD or higher) was only weakly associated with negative outcomes related to delinquency, grades and depression only, and at levels unlikely to be practically significant. Results conceptually replicate those of Przybylski (2014) with a US sample for depression and delinquency as outcomes. Moderate use of screens, though in excess of the AAP’s historical recommendations, are unassociated with problem outcomes.

While most stigma researchers assume that there is a direct correspondence between the attitude of prejudiced individuals and the targets (i.e., sexism affects women, racism affects racial minorities), the five studies reported here demonstrate that White women can be threatened by racism (Study 1, 3, 4, and 5) and men of color by sexism (Study 2). Robust to perceptions of liking and the order in which measures were administered, results showed that prejudice transfers between racism and sexism were driven by the presumed social dominance orientation of the prejudiced individual.

While yawning is widespread, the observation of contagious yawning is most often limited to apes and other mammals with sophisticated social cognition. This has led to speculation on the adaptive value of contagious yawning. Among this speculation are empirical and methodological assumptions demanding re-examination. In this paper we demonstrate that if yawns are not contagious, they may still appear to be so by way of a perceptual pattern-recognition error. Under a variety of conditions (including the assumption that yawns are contagious) we quantify (via models) the extent to which the empirical literature commits Type-1 error (i.e., incorrectly calling a spontaneous yawn ‘contagious’). We report the results of a pre-registered behavioural experiment to validate our model and support our criticisms. Finally, we quantify – based on a synthesis of behavioural and simulated data – how ‘contagious’ a yawn is by describing the size of the influence a ‘trigger’ yawn has on the likelihood of a consequent yawn. We conclude by raising a number of empirical and methodological concerns that aid in resolving higher-order questions regarding the nature of contagious yawning, and make public our model to help aid further study and understanding.","2017-02-13","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2017-02-20 16:25:58","1-22","","","","","Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology","Are Yawns really Contagious?","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/k4vpt/","","","http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-017-0059-y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The worst performance rule (WPR) finesses this relation by stating that the association between IQ and elementary-task performance is most pronounced when this performance is summarized by people’s slowest responses. Previous research has shown that the WPR can be accounted for in the Ratcliff diffusion model by assuming that the same ability parameter—drift rate—mediates performance in both elementary tasks and higher-level cognitive tasks. Here we aim to test four qualitative predictions concerning the WPR and its diffusion model explanation in terms of drift rate. In the first stage, the diffusion model was fit to data from 916 participants completing a perceptual two-choice task; crucially, the fitting happened after randomly shuffling the key variable, i.e., each participant’s score on a working memory capacity test. In the second stage, after all modeling decisions were made, the key variable was unshuffled and the adequacy of the predictions was evaluated by means of confirmatory Bayesian hypothesis tests. By temporarily withholding the mapping of the key predictor, we retain flexibility for proper modeling of the data (e.g., outlier exclusion) while preventing biases from unduly influencing the results. Our results provide evidence against the WPR and suggest that it may be less robust and less ubiquitous than is commonly believed.","2017-02-23","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2017-02-28 13:56:51","1-13","","","","","Atten Percept Psychophys","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/qc5dh/","","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-017-1304-y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is little research on how CAT is best applied to working with psychosis. This study aimed to identify what the key aspects of CAT for psychosis are or whether this approach requires adaptation when applied to those with experiences of psychosis, drawing on expert opinion. Method An adapted Delphi methodology was used. Items were generated during an initial workshop (N = 24) and then rated for agreement or importance via an online survey by a sample of experts with experience of CAT and working clinically with psychosis (N = 14). Results Following two rounds of ratings, consensus was reached on most items. Additional comments emphasized the need to be flexible with regard to the varying needs of individual clients. Conclusions Results highlight the specific relational understanding of psychosis provided by CAT as one of the key elements of this approach. Responses emphasized the need for some level of adaptation to work with psychosis, including greater flexibility with regard to the treatment frame. Practitioner Points * When working with experiences of psychosis, aspects of the CAT model, such as session length, pacing, and duration of therapy, are open to change and may require modification. * When working with experiences of psychosis, narrative reformulation letters and sequential diagrammatic reformulation (SDR) remain essential to the therapy. * This Delphi methodology study essentially relies on opinion. Further empirical research could test assumptions about the most important or therapeutically effective components of CAT in psychosis. * CAT is still not widely used in the context of psychosis limiting the pool of experts available for the current sample.","2017-02-01","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2020-10-18 17:38:42","2017-02-27 14:27:02","n/a-n/a","","","","","Psychol Psychother Theory Res Pract","What are the key elements of cognitive analytic therapy for psychosis?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","https://osf.io/zrqj2/","","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papt.12119/abstract","","psychosis; cognitive analytic therapy; consensus; Delphi method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a unifying neurocognitive framework of mechanisms underlying information sharing at scale (virality). We argue that expectations regarding self-related and social consequences of sharing (e.g., in the form of potential for self-enhancement or social approval) are integrated into a domain-general value signal that encodes the value of sharing a piece of information. This value signal translates into population-level virality. In two studies (n = 41 and 39 participants), we tested these hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Neural activity in response to 80 New York Times articles was observed in theory-driven regions of interest associated with value, self, and social cognitions. This activity then was linked to objectively logged population-level data encompassing n = 117,611 internet shares of the articles. In both studies, activity in neural regions associated with self-related and social cognition was indirectly related to population-level sharing through increased neural activation in the brain's value system. Neural activity further predicted population-level outcomes over and above the variance explained by article characteristics and commonly used self-report measures of sharing intentions. This parsimonious framework may help advance theory, improve predictive models, and inform new approaches to effective intervention. More broadly, these data shed light on the core functions of sharing—to express ourselves in positive ways and to strengthen our social bonds.","2017-02-27","2020-10-18 17:38:41","2020-10-18 17:38:41","2017-03-06 14:38:24","201615259","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","https://osf.io/zi3v8/","","; ","http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/02/22/1615259114.full; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242678","","fMRI; psychological mechanisms; Sharing; valuation; virality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although we found some support for this hypothesis, an improved analysis and further studies indicated that the effect was strongly dependent on the stimuli used. We then used stimulus sampling and showed that the original association between fluency and perceived safety was not replicable with the newly constructed stimuli. We found the association between fluency and perceived safety using the newly constructed stimuli in a final study, but only when pronounceability was confounded with word length.

A third study provided evidence that differences in self-efficacy regarding food mediate the relationship between theories of weight and eating behavior (Study 3). One way to encourage healthy eating might be to develop interventions that encourage more incremental views of weight.","2017-04-01","2020-10-18 17:38:36","2020-10-18 17:38:36","2017-04-11 13:36:59","n/a-n/a","","","","","J Appl Soc Psychol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","https://osf.io/6px9g/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed methodological problems of a me/not-me response latency task developed in this literature by proposing changes in material, calculation of indices and implemented the task in an online environment. We also addressed earlier problems with statistical power and proposed a more powerful way of statistical analyses using mixed models. The me/not-me task is based on the idea that higher overlap between self and other traits results in faster response times of characterizing such a trait as descriptive of the self. This relationship should be observed for close others but not for non-close others. In a sample of 339 U.S American adults, we experimentally manipulated the nature of the target (close vs. distant) and participants engaged in the adapted me/not-me paradigm. Results indicated that trait match had a stronger negative effect on response times for participants in the close condition. The effect was also stronger for participants rating the target higher on the IOS self-report scale.

In sentence-picture verification tasks, whenever pictures match the shape or orientation implied by the previous sentence, responses are faster than when the pictures mismatch implied visual aspects. However, mixed results have been demonstrated when the sentence-picture paradigm was applied to color (Connell, Cognition, 102(3), 476–485, 2007; Zwaan & Pecher, PLOS ONE, 7(12), e51382, 2012). One of the aims of the current investigation was to resolve this issue. This was accomplished by conceptually replicating the original study on color, using the same paradigm but a different stimulus set. The second goal of this study was to assess how much perceptual information is included in a mental simulation. We examined this by reducing color saturation, a manipulation that does not sacrifice object identifiability. If reduction of one aspect of color does not alter the match effect, it would suggest that not all perceptual information is relevant for a mental simulation. Our results did not support this: We found a match advantage when objects were shown at normal levels of saturation, but this match advantage disappeared when saturation was reduced, yet still aided in object recognition compared to when color was entirely removed. Taken together, these results clearly show a strong match effect for color, and the perceptual richness of mental simulations during language comprehension.","2017-04-24","2020-10-18 17:38:36","2020-10-18 17:38:36","2017-05-01 13:18:34","1-9","","","","","Mem Cogn","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/r6ghm/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present two high-powered experimental studies, a close and a conceptual replication of the ‘Police Officer's Dilemma’ (Correll et al., 2002). Experiment 1 (N = 164)—a close replication—uses the original shooter task with Arab-Muslim targets. Participants showed a so-called shooter bias: A significant interaction in reaction times with faster ‘shoot’ responses for armed Arab-Muslim targets compared to armed White targets (ηp2 = .11, 90% CI [.04; .18]). This provides evidence that the shooter bias is robust against context variations. Experiment 2 (N = 165)—a conceptual replication and extension—investigates whether this effect generalizes to other threat-related behavior. In a novel ‘avoidance task’ with Turkish and White German targets, participants ‘avoid’ armed targets carrying knives and ‘approach’ unarmed targets carrying innocuous objects. Again, we observed a significant interaction effect: Reaction times were faster for armed Turkish targets, but slower for unarmed Turkish targets as compared to White German targets (ηp2 =.19, 90% CI [.11; .27]). Results are interpreted as an avoidance bias—an effect almost twice as large as in the original shooter task. We discuss that the avoidance task may be cognitively more demanding than the shooter task and that the avoidance task may provide a more subtle measure of bias in threat detection. This may lead participants to exert less behavioral control. Taken together, this research highlights that threat stereotypes have powerful influences on judgment and behavior, with the potential to disrupt intergroup interactions.","2017-05","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2017-01-10 14:36:08","41-47","","","70","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","The shooter bias","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: essien_shooter_2017 https://osf.io/rq6h2/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\V9M53836\S0022103116303018.html","","","Threat; Replication; Avoidance bias; Police officer's dilemma; Shooter bias; Stereotypes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this type of search, observers are more likely to miss a second target after having found a first one (a subsequent search miss). Recent evidence has suggested that this effect may be due to a depletion of cognitive resources from tracking the identities and locations of found targets. Given that tracking moving objects is resource-demanding, would finding a moving target further increase the chances of missing a subsequent one? To address this question, we had participants search for one or more targets hidden among distractors. Subsequent search misses were more likely when the targets and distractors moved throughout the display than when they remained stationary. However, when the found targets were highlighted in a unique color, subsequent search misses were no more likely in moving displays. Together, these results suggest that the effect of movement is likely due to the increased cognitive demands of tracking moving targets. Overall, our findings reveal that activities that involve searching for moving targets (e.g., driving) are more susceptible to subsequent search misses than are those that involve searching for stationary targets (e.g., baggage screening).","2017-05-08","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2017-05-17 15:48:28","1-7","","","","","Psychon Bull Rev","Satisfaction in motion","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/aqehj/?view_only=e617d57f7bdb4d0995016a39ff69fe50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assessed the association over 8 years between mass media expenditure in England and quit attempts, smoking cessation and smoking prevalence. Methods Autoregressive integrated moving average modelling with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) was applied to monthly estimates from the Smoking Toolkit Study between June 2008 and February 2016. We assessed the association between the trends in mass media expenditure and (1) quit attempts in the last two months, (2) quit success among those who attempted to quit and (3) smoking prevalence. Analyses were adjusted for trends in weekly spending on tobacco by smokers, tobacco control policies and the use of established aids to cessation. Results Monthly spending on mass media campaigns ranged from nothing to £2.4 million, with a mean of £465 054. An increase in mass media expenditure of 10% of the monthly average was associated with a 0.51% increase (of the average) in success rates of quit attempts (95% CI 0.10% to 0.91%, p=0.014). No clear association was detected between changes in mass media expenditure and changes in quit attempt prevalence (β=–0.03, 95% CI –2.05% to 2.00%, p=0.979) or smoking prevalence (β=–0.03, 95% CI –0.09% to 0.03%, p=0.299). Conclusion Between 2008 and 2016, higher monthly expenditure on tobacco control mass media campaigns in England was associated with higher quit success rates.","2017-06-30","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2017-07-10 17:14:43","tobaccocontrol-2017-053662","","","","","","Associations between tobacco control mass media campaign expenditure and smoking prevalence and quitting in England","","","","","","","en","© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

We offer a systematic approach to addressing this challenge and implement it in the domain of money priming. In three preregistered experiments (N = 4,649), participants were exposed to one of a number of money manipulations before completing self-report measures of money activation (Study 1); engaging in a behavioral-persistence task (Study 3); completing self-report measures of subjective wealth, self-sufficiency, and communion-agency (Studies 1–3); and completing demographic questions (Studies 1–3). Four of the five manipulations we tested activated the concept of money, but, contrary to what we expected based on the preponderance of the published literature, no manipulation consistently affected any dependent measure. Moderation by sociodemographic characteristics was sparse and inconsistent across studies. We discuss implications for theories of money priming and explain how our approach can complement recent efforts to build a reproducible, cumulative psychological science.","2017-07-05","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2020-10-18 17:38:35","2017-07-11 14:23:06","0956797617706161","","","","","Psychol Sci","Show Me the Money","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has shown that multisensory presentation of olfactory and visual information may strengthen the processing of disgust-relevant information. However, it is not known whether these findings extend to dynamic facial stimuli that changes from neutral to emotionally expressive, or if individual differences in trait body odor disgust may influence the processing of disgust-related information. In this preregistered study, we tested whether a classification of dynamic facial expressions as happy or disgusted, and an emotional evaluation of these facial expressions, would be affected by individual differences in body odor disgust sensitivity, and by exposure to a sweat-like, negatively valenced odor (valeric acid), as compared with a soap-like, positively valenced odor (lilac essence) or a no-odor control. Using Bayesian hypothesis testing, we found evidence that odors do not affect recognition of emotion in dynamic faces even when body odor disgust sensitivity was used as moderator. However, an exploratory analysis suggested that an unpleasant odor context may cause faster RTs for faces, independent of their emotional expression. Our results further our understanding of the scope and limits of odor effects on facial perception affect and suggest further studies should focus on reproducibility, specifying experimental circumstances where odor effects on facial expressions may be present versus absent.","2017-07-14","2020-10-18 17:38:34","2020-10-18 17:38:34","2017-07-18 14:07:59","0301006617720831","","","","","Perception","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Citation Key: syrjanen_valenced_2017 https://osf.io/afsc6/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine whether different evaluations of stimulus characteristics shape amygdala activation, we conducted a preregistered replication of Cunningham, Van Bavel, and Johnsen’s (2008) study demonstrating flexible mapping of amygdala activation to stimulus characteristics, depending on evaluative goals. Participants underwent functional MRI scanning while viewing famous names under three conditions: They were asked to report their overall attitude toward each name, their positive associations only, or their negative associations only. We observed an interaction between condition and rating type, identified as the effect of interest in Cunningham et al. (2008). Specifically, postscan positivity, but not negativity, ratings predicted left amygdala activation when participants were asked to evaluate positive, but not negative, associations with the names. These results provide convergent evidence that cognitive framing, in the form of evaluative goals, can significantly alter whether amygdala activation indexes positivity or negativity.","2017-08-09","2020-10-18 17:38:34","2020-10-18 17:38:34","2017-08-16 14:32:27","0956797617719730","","","","","Psychol Sci","Preregistered Replication of “Affective Flexibility","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","https://osf.io/bifc7/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research addresses this gap in the empirical literature by testing the primary hypothesis that high-power people discount others’ praise more than equal- and low-power people. Secondary hypotheses also tested whether high-power people’s tendency to discount positive feedback would paradoxically heighten negative perceptions of others. Evidence from two experiments (one preregistered) reveals that high-power participants discounted feedback from others more than low- and equal-power participants. However, high-power people’s tendency to discount feedback only produced negative partner perceptions when positive feedback, but not neutral feedback, was discounted.

Here, we test a hypothesis derived from construal theory, about one way in which mediated communication might increase spatial distance, by imposing social distance between two texting partners. In three studies, the social distance generated by a text conversation correlated with estimates of spatial distance.

In a controlled experimental setting, we found that a favorable ruling, when presented as likely, shifted perceived norms and personal attitudes toward increased support for gay marriage and gay people. Next, a five-wave longitudinal time-series study using a sample of 1,063 people found an increase in perceived social norms supporting gay marriage after the ruling but no change in personal attitudes.

We examined whether moral violations analogously elicit distinct behavioral responses, focusing on desires to confront and avoid moral violators. Participants read scenarios depicting harmful and impure actions (Study 1) or violations of all six content domains proposed by Moral Foundations Theory (Study 2). Bayesian inference revealed that participants expressed distinctively high levels of desire to avoid (vs. confront) violators of purity norms. Violations of other moral norms did not similarly elicit unique patterns of avoidance or confrontation. Thus, behavioral responses to moral violators depend in part on which norm was violated, with impure acts eliciting a uniquely strong avoidance response.

Across four studies (n = 1,377) sampling White and Black Americans from the top and bottom of the national income distribution, participants overestimated progress toward Black–White economic equality, largely driven by estimates of greater current equality than actually exists according to national statistics. Overestimates of current levels of racial economic equality, on average, outstripped reality by roughly 25% and were predicted by greater belief in a just world and social network racial diversity (among Black participants). Whereas high-income White respondents tended to overestimate racial economic equality in the past, Black respondents, on average, underestimated the degree of past racial economic equality. Two follow-up experiments further revealed that making societal racial discrimination salient increased the accuracy of Whites’ estimates of Black–White economic equality, whereas encouraging Whites to anchor their estimates on their own circumstances increased their tendency to overestimate current racial economic equality. Overall, these findings suggest a profound misperception of and unfounded optimism regarding societal race-based economic equality—a misperception that is likely to have any number of important policy implications.","2017-09-18","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2017-09-25 13:59:04","201707719","","","","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.pnas.org","","Citation Key: kraus_americans_2017 00000  PMID: 28923915","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923915; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28923915","","socioeconomic status; racial disparities; economic inequality; motivated perception; racial stratification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent attempts to demonstrate this under transparent conditions have failed to yield positive results. In the current study, we monitor two groups of students (N1 = 8,867, N2 = 8,754) over separate 17-week intervals with 24-hour coverage, as they engage in voluntary learning and self-testing using an online program. We use daily behavior to assess whether time-of-day effects support domain-general theories of self-control. Additionally, we assess whether mental fatigue emerges within task during prolonged persistent effort. Results reveal within-task fatigue emerges within an hour on-task. However, there is a negligible effect on ability throughout the day. Additionally, time-of-day has no detrimental effect on motivation; rather there is a strong tendency to increase learning time at night. Results are consistent with theories indicating people lose motivation within a specific task, but at odds with theories that argue for a domain-general self-control resource.","2017-09-20","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2017-09-26 13:55:39","e0182980","","9","12","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Citation Key: randles_pre-registered_2017 00000  https://osf.io/rgmv9/register/564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2c0","","","","","Psychology; Learning; memory; Decision making; Mathematical models; Fatigue; Human learning; Language acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is already well established that under most conditions, contingency awareness is important for an EC effect to occur. In addition to that, some findings suggest that awareness of the stimulus pairs is not only relevant during the learning phase, but that it is also relevant whether memory for the pairings is still available during the measurement phase. As previous research has shown that memory is better after temporally distributed than after contiguous (massed) repetitions, it seems plausible that also EC effects are moderated by distributed practice manipulations. This was tested in the current studies. In two experiments with successful distributed practice manipulations on memory, we show that also the magnitude of the EC effect was larger for pairs learned under spaced compared to massed conditions. Both effects, on memory and on EC, are found after a within-participant and after a between-participant manipulation. However, we did not find significant differences in the EC effect for different conditions of spaced practice. These findings are in line with the assumption that EC is based on similar processes as memory for the pairings.","2017-09","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2020-10-18 17:38:33","2017-07-10 17:48:05","1-13","","","179","","Acta Psychologica","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","https://osf.io/tvqv4/","","","","","distributed practice; Evaluative conditioning; Contingency awareness; Contingency memory; Implicit evaluations; Unmixed lists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Personality traits are embedded early in life and remain relatively stable, whereas grit (at least the passion component) may come and go and thus be malleable. Leonard et al. show that infants can learn from adults to persist through failure at arduous tasks (see the Perspective by Butler). Infants who had observed adults struggle for half a minute before activating a toy persisted when given their own complicated toy to play with, in contrast to the lesser grit displayed by infants who had seen only rapid and effortless adult successes. Science, this issue p. 1290; see also p. 1236 Persistence, above and beyond IQ, is associated with long-term academic outcomes. To look at the effect of adult models on infants’ persistence, we conducted an experiment in which 15-month-olds were assigned to one of three conditions: an Effort condition in which they saw an adult try repeatedly, using various methods, to achieve each of two different goals; a No Effort condition in which the adult achieved the goals effortlessly; or a Baseline condition. Infants were then given a difficult, novel task. Across an initial study and two preregistered experiments (N = 262), infants in the Effort condition made more attempts to achieve the goal than did infants in the other conditions. Pedagogical cues modulated the effect. The results suggest that adult models causally affect infants’ persistence and that infants can generalize the value of persistence to novel tasks. Infants go beyond imitating the actions of adults to imitating the amount of effort expended.

During fMRI, participants viewed pictures of needles pricking a hand (pain) or Q-tips touching a hand (control), a well-established paradigm to investigate empathy for pain. There was no main effect of sleep restriction on empathy. However, age and sleep interacted so that sleep restriction caused increased unpleasantness in older but not in young participants. Irrespective of sleep condition, older participants showed increased activity in angular gyrus, superior temporal sulcus and temporo-parietal junction compared to young.

In a forced-choice task, 2- to 4-year-olds successfully identified probable causes of five distinct positive emotional vocalizations elicited by what adults would consider funny, delicious, exciting, sympathetic, and adorable stimuli (Experiment 1). Similar results were obtained in a preferential looking paradigm with 12- to 23-month-olds, a direct replication with 18- to 23-month-olds (Experiment 2), and a simplified design with 12- to 17-month-olds (Experiment 3; preregistered). Moreover, 12- to 17-month-olds selectively explored, given improbable causes of different positive emotional reactions (Experiments 4 and 5; preregistered). The results suggest that by the second year of life, children make sophisticated and subtle distinctions among a wide range of positive emotions and reason about the probable causes of others’ emotional reactions.

We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator’s own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities. These results suggest that the medium through which people communicate may systematically influence the impressions they form of each other.

In the present study                     the authors investigated anger and depressive rumination as correlates of                     internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Cross-sectional confirmatory                     factor analyses on data from 764 young adults from the Colorado Longitudinal                     Twin Study indicated that anger and depressive rumination were separable at the                     latent variable level and were both associated with lifetime symptoms of                     internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. However, depressive rumination                     was more strongly associated with psychopathology than was anger rumination.

However, the precise impact of both transient and pathological anxiety on higher-order cognitive functions, including short- and long-term memory, is poorly understood. A clearer understanding of the anxiety–memory relationship is important as one of the core symptoms of anxiety, most prominently in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is intrusive reexperiencing of traumatic events in the form of vivid memories. This study therefore aimed to examine the impact of induced anxiety (threat of shock) on memory encoding and retrieval. Eighty-six healthy participants completed tasks assessing: visuospatial working memory, verbal recognition, face recognition, and associative memory. Critically, anxiety was manipulated within-subjects: information was both encoded and retrieved under threat of shock and safe (no shock) conditions. Results revealed that visuospatial working memory was enhanced when information was encoded and subsequently retrieved under threat, and that threat impaired the encoding of faces regardless of the condition in which it was retrieved. Episodic memory and verbal short-term recognition were, however, unimpaired. These findings indicate that transient anxiety in healthy individuals has domain-specific, rather than domain-general, impacts on memory. Future studies would benefit from expanding these findings into anxiety disorder patients to delineate the differences between adaptive and maladaptive responding.","2017-10-01","2020-10-18 17:38:26","2020-10-18 17:38:26","2017-09-19 14:44:32","532-542","","10","24","","Learn.

Although there is a widespread perception that environmental influences on the epigenome are pervasive and profound, there has been little evidence to date in humans with respect to environmental factors that are biologically distal. Here we provide evidence on the associations between epigenetic modifications—in our case, CpG methylation—and educational attainment (EA), a biologically distal environmental factor that is arguably among the most important life-shaping experiences for individuals. Specifically, we report the results of an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of EA based on data from 27 cohort studies with a total of 10 767 individuals. We find nine CpG probes significantly associated with EA. However, robustness analyses show that all nine probes have previously been found to be associated with smoking. Only two associations remain when we perform a sensitivity analysis in the subset of never-smokers, and these two probes are known to be strongly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, and thus their association with EA could be due to correlation between EA and maternal smoking. Moreover, the effect sizes of the associations with EA are far smaller than the known associations with the biologically proximal environmental factors alcohol consumption, body mass index, smoking and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Follow-up analyses that combine the effects of many probes also point to small methylation associations with EA that are highly correlated with the combined effects of smoking.

Most studies of this “inattentional blindness” use unexpected objects that are irrelevant to the primary task and to the participant (e.g., gorillas in basketball games or colored shapes in computerized tracking tasks). Although a few studies have examined noticing rates for personally relevant or task-relevant unexpected objects, few have done so in a real-world context with objects that represent a direct threat to the participant. In this study, police academy trainees (n = 100) and experienced police officers (n = 75) engaged in a simulated vehicle traffic stop in which they approached a vehicle to issue a warning or citation for running a stop sign. The driver was either passive and cooperative or agitated and hostile when complying with the officer’s instructions. Overall, 58% of the trainees and 33% of the officers failed to notice a gun positioned in full view on the passenger dashboard. The driver’s style of interaction had little effect on noticing rates for either group. People can experience inattentional blindness for a potentially dangerous object in a naturalistic real-world context, even when noticing that object would change how they perform their primary task and even when their training focuses on awareness of potential threats.","2017-12-01","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2017-09-26 14:05:15","37","","1","2","","Cogn.

These programs often transmit stereotypes about gender roles such as “math is for boys and not for girls.” So far, however, it is unclear whether stereotypes that are embedded in television programs affect girls’ and boys’ performance, motivational dispositions or attitudes. On the basis of research on expectancy-value theory and stereotype threat, we conducted a randomized study with a total of 335 fifth-grade students to address this question. As the experimental material, we used a television program that had originally been produced for a national TV channel. The program was designed to show children that math could be interesting and fun. In the experimental condition, the program included a gender stereotyped segment in which two girls who were frustrated with math copied their math homework from a male classmate. In the control condition, participants watched an equally long, neutral summary of the first part of the video. We investigated effects on boys’ and girls’ stereotype endorsement, math performance, and different motivational constructs to gain insights into differential effects. On the basis of prior research, we expected negative effects of watching the stereotypes on girls’ performance, motivational dispositions, and attitudes. Effects on the same outcomes for boys as well as children’s stereotype endorsement were explored as open questions. We preregistered our research predictions and analyses before conducting the experiment. Our results provide partial support for short-term effects of gender stereotypes embedded in television programs: Watching the stereotypes embedded in the video increased boys’ and girls’ stereotype endorsement. Boys reported a higher sense of belonging but lower utility value after watching the video with the stereotypes. Boys’ other outcome variables were not affected, and there were also no effects on girl’s performance, motivational dispositions, or attitudes. Results offer initial insights into how even short segments involving gender stereotypes in television shows can influence girls’ and boys’ stereotype endorsement and how such stereotypes may constitute one factor that contributes to gender differences in the STEM fields.","2018","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2018-11-28 18:41:23","","","","9","","Front.

Leucht et al. in 2012 described an overview of meta-analyses of the efficacy of medication in psychiatry and general medicine, concluding that psychiatric drugs were not less efficacious than other drugs. Our goal was to explore the dissemination of this highly cited paper, which combined a thought provoking message with a series of caveats. Methods. We conducted a prospectively registered citation content analysis. All papers published before June 1st citing the target paper were independently rated by two investigators. The primary outcome coded dichotomously was whether the citation was used to justify a small or modest effect observed for a given treatment. Secondary outcomes regarded mentioning any caveats when citing the target paper, the point the citation was making (treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine, others), the type of condition (psychiatric, medical or both), specific disease, treatment category and specific type. We also extracted information about the type of citing paper, financial conflict of interest (COI) declared and any industry support. The primary analysis was descriptive by tabulating the extracted variables, with numbers and percentages where appropriate. Co-authorship networks were constructed to identify possible clusters of citing authors. An exploratory univariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between each of a subset of pre-specified secondary outcomes and the primary outcome.   Results. We identified 135 records and retrieved and analysed 120. Sixty-three (53%) quoted Leucht et al.’s paper to justify a small or modest effect observed for a given therapy, and 113 (94%) did not mention any caveats. Seventy-two (60%) used the citation to claim that treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine; 110 (91%) paper were about psychiatric conditions. Forty-one (34%) papers quoted it without pointing towards any specific treatment category, 28 (23%) were about antidepressants, 18 (15%) about antipsychotics. Forty (33%) of the citing papers included data. COIs were reported in 55 papers (46%). Univariate and multivariate regressions showed an association between a quote justifying small or modest effects and the point that treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine. Conclusions. Our evaluation revealed an overwhelmingly uncritical reception and seemed to indicate that beyond defending psychiatry as a discipline, the paper by Leucht et al. served to lend support and credibility to a therapeutic myth: trivial effects of mental health interventions, most often drugs, are to be expected and therefore accepted.

We used faces of identical twins discordant for smoking, and prototypes made by averaging the faces of the twins. In Task 1, we presented exemplar twin sets and same sex prototypes side-by-side and participants (n = 590) indicated which face was the smoker. Participants were blind to smoking status. In Task 2 a separate sample (n = 580) indicated which face was more attractive. For the exemplar twin sets, there was inconclusive evidence participants selected the smoking twin as the smoker more often, or selected the non-smoking twin as the more attractive more often. For the prototypes, however, participants clearly selected the smoking prototypes as the smoker more often, and the non-smoking prototypes as the more attractive. Prototypical faces of smokers are judged more attractive and correctly identified as smokers more often than prototypical faces of matched non-smokers.

Findings of seemingly high-level object-scene integration in the absence of awareness have challenged major theories in the field and attracted considerable scientific interest. Lately, one of these findings has been questioned because of a failure to replicate, yet the other finding was still uncontested. Here, we show that this latter finding—slowed-down performance on a visible target following a masked prime scene that includes an incongruent object—is also not reproducible. Using Bayesian statistics, we found evidence against unconscious integration of objects and scenes. Put differently, at the moment, there is no compelling evidence for object-scene congruency processing in the absence of awareness.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that writing about conflicted personal goals and values (conflict condition) would impair self-control on an unrelated subsequent task as compared to writing about clear personal goals and values (clarity condition). Personal conflict activates the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; Hirsh, Mar, &amp; Peterson, 2012), which may make it harder for participants to successfully execute self-control. In this large (N = 337), pre-registered study participants in the conflict condition performed worse on anagrams than participants in the clarity condition, and the effect of condition on anagram performance was mediated by a subjective uncertainty measure of BIS activation. This suggests that BIS activation leads to poor self-control. Moreover, given that conflict is inherent in the exercise of self-control, results point to BIS activation as a mechanism for why initial acts of self-control impair self-control on subsequent, unrelated tasks.","2018-01","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2017-10-09 13:11:15","157-160","","","74","","Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","Personal conflict impairs performance on an unrelated self-control task","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: alquist_personal_2018 00000  https://osf.io/num4y/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What happens, then, to the changes in neuronal gene expression that were initially required to encode and maintain the memory? Here we show that the decay of recall for long-term sensitization memory in Aplysia is accompanied both by a form of savings memory (easier relearning) and by persistent transcriptional regulation. A behavioral experiment (N = 14) shows that sensitization training produces a robust long-term sensitization memory, but that recall fades completely within 1 wk. This apparent forgetting, though, is belied by persistent savings memory, as we found that a weak reminder protocol reinstates a long-term sensitization memory only on the previously trained side of the body. Using microarray (N = 8 biological replicates), we found that transcriptional regulation largely decays along with recall. Of the transcripts known to be regulated 1 d after training, 98% (1172/1198) are no longer significantly regulated 7 d after training. Still, there is a small set of transcripts which remain strongly regulated even when recall is absent. Using qPCR (N = 11 additional biological replicates) we confirmed that these include the peptide transmitter FMRFamide, a transcript encoding a putative homolog of spectrin beta chain (Genbank: EB255259) , a transcript encoding a protein with a predicted EF-hand calcium-binding domain (Genbank: EB257711), and eight uncharacterized transcripts. To our knowledge, this is the first work to show that transcriptional changes evoked by learning can outlast recall. The small set of transcriptional changes that persist could mediate the rapid relearning of the memory (savings), or the decay of recall, or both, or neither.","2018-01-01","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2020-10-18 17:38:25","2017-12-19 19:20:24","45-48","","1","25","","Learn.

However, most researchers who conduct priming studies fail to explicitly report double-blind procedures. Because experimenter expectations may influence participant behavior, we asked whether a short pre-experiment interaction between participants and experimenters would contribute to priming effects when experimenters were not blind to participant condition. An initial double-blind experiment failed to demonstrate the expected effects of a social prime on executive cognition. To determine whether double-blind procedures caused this result, we independently manipulated participants’ exposure to a prime and experimenters’ belief about which prime participants received. Across four experiments, we found that experimenter belief, rather than prime condition, altered participant behavior. Experimenter belief also altered participants’ perceptions of their experimenter, suggesting that differences in experimenter behavior across conditions caused the effect.

Guidance for how to provide effective reassurance is scarce and there may be a need to counter patient concerns arising from misinterpretation of spinal imaging findings. ‘GLITtER’ (Green Light Imaging Intervention to Enhance Recovery) was developed as a standardised method of communicating imaging findings in a manner that is reassuring and promotes engagement in an active recovery. This feasibility study is an important step towards definitive testing of its effect. Methods This feasibility study was a prospective, quasi-randomised, parallel trial with longitudinal follow-up, involving sampling of patients attending a spinal outpatient clinic at a metropolitan hospital. English speaking adults (18–75 years) presenting to the clinic with low back pain and prior spinal imaging were considered for inclusion. Eligible patients were allocated to receive a GLITtER consultation or a standard consultation (as determined by appointment scheduling and clinician availability), and were blinded to their allocation. Full details of the GLITtER intervention are described in accordance with the Tidier template.Follow-up data were collected after 1 and 3 months. The primary outcome of this study was the fulfillment of specific feasibility criteria which were established a priori. Determination of a sample size for a definitive randomised controlled trial was a secondary objective. Results Two hundred seventy-six patients underwent preliminary screening and 31 patients met the final eligibility criteria for study inclusion. Seventeen participants were allocated to the intervention group and 14 were allocated to the control group. Three month follow-up data were available from 42% of the 31 enrolled participants (N = 13, six intervention, seven control). Feasibility indicators for consent, resource burden and acceptability of the GLITtER intervention were met, however participant recruitment was slower than anticipated and an acceptable follow-up rate was not achieved. Conclusions Failure to achieve pre-specified recruitment and follow-up rates were important outcomes of this feasibility study. We attribute failure to issues that are likely to be relevant for other clinical trials with this population. It is realistic to consider that these challenges can be overcome through careful strategy, ample funding and continued partnership with health care providers.

Results 37 RCTs (21 from The BMJ and 16 from PLOS Medicine) published between 2013 and 2016 met the eligibility criteria. 17/37 (46%, 95% confidence interval 30% to 62%) satisfied the definition of data availability and 14 of the 17 (82%, 59% to 94%) were fully reproduced on all their primary outcomes. Of the remaining RCTs, errors were identified in two but reached similar conclusions and one paper did not provide enough information in the Methods section to reproduce the analyses. Difficulties identified included problems in contacting corresponding authors and lack of resources on their behalf in preparing the datasets. In addition, there was a range of different data sharing practices across study groups. Conclusions Data availability was not optimal in two journals with a strong policy for data sharing. When investigators shared data, most reanalyses largely reproduced the original results. Data sharing practices need to become more widespread and streamlined to allow meaningful reanalyses and reuse of data.

The more people merely watch others perform (without actually practicing themselves), the more they nonetheless believe they could perform the skill, too (Experiment 1). However, people’s actual abilities—from throwing darts and doing the moonwalk to playing an online game—do not improve after merely watching others, despite predictions to the contrary (Experiments 2–4). What do viewers see that makes them think they are learning? We found that extensive viewing allows people to track what steps to take (Experiment 5) but not how those steps feel when taking them. Accordingly, experiencing a “taste” of performing attenuates the illusion: Watching others juggle but then holding the pins oneself tempers perceived change in one’s own ability (Experiment 6).

In patients with IBD who are unresponsive to their first induction dose, the implementation of an ‘accelerated’ induction dose schedule (doses more frequent than recommended in product monographs) is becoming increasingly common. It is unclear whether this practice results in favourable patient outcomes, such as avoidance of surgery and disease remission. As such, there is a need to identify and map the current evidence base on accelerated induction schedules of these medications in the treatment of IBD. Methods and analysis A scoping review will be employed to systematically identify and characterise the nature of scientific literature on accelerated induction regimens of TNF-alpha inhibitors. MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and grey literature will be searched to identify relevant studies. The titles/abstracts of all records and full text of potentially relevant articles will be independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers. Data will be abstracted from included studies by one reviewer and verified for accuracy by another. The findings will be synthesised descriptively.

In this paper, we took a person-centered statistical approach to group adolescent gamers by levels of addiction-related symptoms and gaming-related problems, compared these groups to traditional scale scores for IGD, and checked how groups were related to psychosocial well-being using a preregistered analysis plan. We performed latent class analysis and regression with items from IGD and psychosocial well-being scales in a representative sample of 7865 adolescent European gamers. Symptoms and problems matched in only two groups: an IGD class (2.2%) having a high level of symptoms and problems and a Normative class (63.5%) having low levels of symptoms and problems. We also identified two classes comprising 30.9% of our sample that would be misclassified based on their report of gaming-related problems: an Engaged class (7.3%) that seemed to correspond to the engaged gamers described in previous literature, and a Concerned class (23.6%) reporting few symptoms but moderate to high levels of problems. Our findings suggest that a reformulation of IGD is needed. Treating Engaged gamers as having IGD when their poor well-being might not be gaming related may delay appropriate treatment, while Concerned gamers may need help to reduce gaming but would not be identified as such. Additional work to describe the phenomenology of these two groups would help refine diagnosis, prevention and treatment for IGD.","2018-01-24","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2018-02-01 21:31:58","1-13","","","","","Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","When addiction symptoms and life problems diverge","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Networks of cooperative social partners and associated norms are vital for pastoralists, such as Saami reindeer herders in northern Norway. However, little is known quantitatively about how norms structure pastoralists' social networks or shape cooperation. Saami herders reported their social networks and participated in field experiments, allowing us to gauge the overlap between reported and emergent cooperation. We show that individuals' perceptions of reciprocal cooperation within their social networks exceeded actual reciprocity, although both occurred frequently and were concentrated within herding groups. Herders with more extensive cooperation networks received more rewards in an economic game. Although herders overestimated reciprocal helping, cooperation in this community was still extensive, suggesting that perceived norms potentially allow network structures promoting cooperation to emerge and be maintained.","2018-02-01","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2018-02-20 21:19:04","171221","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

Drawing on recent findings on the psychological triggers of rationalization, I present results from three field studies, one of which was preregistered, testing the hypothesis that an anticipated reality becoming current triggers an observable boost in people’s rationalizations. San Franciscans rationalized a ban on plastic water bottles, Ontarians rationalized a targeted smoking ban, and Americans rationalized the presidency of Donald Trump, more in the days immediately after these realities became current compared with the days immediately before. Additional findings show evidence for a mechanism underlying these behaviors and rule out alternative accounts.

Building on research showing that déjà vu can be driven by an unrecalled memory of a past experience that relates to the current situation, we sought evidence of memory-based predictive ability during déjà vu states. Déjà vu did not lead to above-chance ability to predict the next turn in a navigational path resembling a previously experienced but unrecalled path (although such resemblance increased reports of déjà vu). However, déjà vu states were accompanied by increased feelings of knowing the direction of the next turn. The results suggest that feelings of premonition during déjà vu occur and can be illusory. Metacognitive bias brought on by the state itself may explain the peculiar association between déjà vu and the feeling of premonition.","2018-03-01","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2020-10-18 17:38:24","2018-03-09 22:27:39","0956797617743018","","","","","Psychol Sci","Déjà Vu","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But this difference was greater when Democrats endorsed the policy (with Republican opposition) than when Republicans endorsed the policy (with Democratic opposition).

This ability, often referred to as theory of mind, reliably engages a specialized network of temporal and prefrontal brain regions in older children and adults, including selective recruitment of temporal-parietal junction (TPJ). To date, how and when this specialized brain organization for ToM arises is unknown due to limitations in functional neuroimaging at younger ages. Here we employed the emerging technique of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the functional brain response across the parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions in 7-month old male and female infants as they viewed different video scenarios of a person searching for a hidden object. Over different conditions, we manipulated whether the person held an accurate (true) or inaccurate (false) belief about the location of the hidden object in the videos. In two separate experiments, we observed that the TPJ, but not other temporal and prefrontal regions, spontaneously tracked with the beliefs of the other person, responding more during scenarios when the other person's belief regarding the location of the object was false compared to scenarios when her belief was true. These results mirror those obtained with adults to show that the TPJ already shows some functional organization relevant to high-level social cognition by around 7-months. Furthermore, these results suggest that infants may draw on similar core mechanisms to implicitly track beliefs as adults do when explicitly reasoning about them. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans selectively engage a network of brain regions, including the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), to track what others think, an ability referred to as theory of mind (ToM). How and when this specialized brain organization for high-level social cognition arises is unknown. Using the emerging technique of near-infrared spectroscopy with 7-month old infants, we observed that activity of the TPJ, but not other temporal and frontal regions, distinguished between scenarios when another person's belief about the location of the object was false compared to scenarios when the belief was true.

Five studies demonstrate that people conflate difficulty of personality assessment items with revelations of deep insights. As a result, popular yet invalid assessments of personality can be seen as “deeper” than assessments from social and personality psychology. In Study 1, participants evaluated items from a popular personality “type” assessment as more difficult and better at revealing deep insights into personality than Big-Five personality inventory items. Studies 2 and 3 replicate this effect experimentally using a manipulation of assessment items’ difficulty. Studies 4 and 5 show that the same effect also holds for a less direct method of supposed personality assessment (e.g., assessments that ask about which colors are associated with trivial concepts). Moderating factors and the popularity of shoddy personality assessments are discussed.","2018-04-04","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2018-04-10 16:34:39","1948550618766409","","","","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","Deeply Confusing","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/gfaje/register/5730e99a9ad5a102c5745a8a?view_only=c40ee46a41cd4e748c9505bdd7afbe00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The idea is that relatedness varies across prime–target pairs, which should be reflected in the size of the priming effect (e.g., cat should prime dog more than animal does). However, it is only insightful to predict item-level priming effects if they can be measured reliably. Thus, in the present study we examined the split-half and test–retest reliabilities of item-level priming effects under conditions that should discourage the use of strategies. The resulting priming effects proved extremely unreliable, and reanalyses of three published priming datasets revealed similar cases of low reliability. These results imply that previous attempts to predict semantic priming were unlikely to be successful. However, one study with an unusually large sample size yielded more favorable reliability estimates, suggesting that big data, in terms of items and participants, should be the future for semantic priming research.","2018-04-05","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2018-04-10 16:33:27","1-11","","","","","Behav Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000  https://osf.io/c8sku","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although smartphones are designed to connect us with others, such smartphone use may create a source of distraction that disconnects us from the people in our immediate social environment. Focusing on one fundamental social relationship—between parents and their children—we examined whether smartphones made parents feel distracted, thereby undermining key benefits parents reap when spending time with their children. Ina field experiment at a science museum (Study 1), we randomly assigned parents to use their phones frequently or infrequently. Frequent phone use led parents to feel more distracted, which in turn impaired feelings of social connection and the meaning that parents derived when spending time with their children. In an additional weeklong diary study (Study 2), we found further evidence that smartphones can distract parents from reaping a sense of social connection when spending time with their children.

Male resource displays often predict future paternal resource investments; however, some conspicuous displays may function as mating effort at the cost of investment potential. Men who tend to make such displays may have less interest in long-term relationship investment and commitment and greater interest in short-term sexual relationships. Undergraduates read descriptions of two men purchasing automobiles with the same budget. One man purchased a new car for the sake of reliability (frugal investment); the other purchased a used car and allocated the remaining funds to conspicuous display features (new paint, larger wheels, louder sound system). Participants rated each character on life history characteristics, relationship interests, and relationship attractiveness. Participants rated the man who invested in flashy display higher on mating effort, lower on parental investment, higher on interest in brief sexual affairs, lower on interest in long-term committed romantic relationships, higher in attractiveness to women for brief sexual affairs, and lower in attractiveness to women for long-term committed romantic relationships, compared to the man with a frugal investment strategy. Participants demonstrated an intuitive understanding that some male conspicuous displays can indicate faster life history strategies. Human male luxury displays associated with high mating effort life histories may mimic the properties of male secondary sexual characteristics across species, and these displays may be more prevalent in environments fostering faster life histories.","2018-04-30","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2018-05-08 13:40:31","1-8","","","","","Evolutionary Psychological Science","What Do Economically Costly Signals Signal?","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000  https://osf.io/rchzd/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These findings constitute central pillars of current accounts distinguishing between implicit and explicit Theory of Mind. In our first experiment, which initially included a replication as well as two manipulations, we failed to replicate the original finding in 2- to 3-year-olds (N = 48). Therefore, we ran a second experiment with the sole purpose of seeing whether the effect can be found in an independent, tightly controlled, sufficiently powered and preregistered replication study. This replication attempt failed again in a sample of 25-month-olds (N = 78), but was successful in a sample of adults (N = 115). In all samples, a surprisingly high number of participants did not correctly anticipate the agent's action during the familiarization phase. This led to massive exclusion rates when adhering to the criteria of the original studies and strongly limits the interpretability of findings from the test phase. We discuss both the reliability of our replication attempts as well as the replicability of non-verbal anticipatory looking paradigms of implicit false belief sensitivity, in general.","2018-05-01","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2018-05-08 13:39:33","172273","","5","5","","","The robustness and generalizability of findings on spontaneous false belief sensitivity","","","","","","","en","© 2018 The Authors..

From this perspective, the associations between pornography use, comfort in sexual communication, and relationship closeness should vary depending on patterns of pornography use within relationships. Several related pre-registered hypotheses were tested using an online cross-sectional survey of heterosexual dyads (N = 200) that were quota sampled to reflect the distribution of age and political affiliation of married American couples. Dyadic analysis indicated that participants who shared pornography use with their partner reported more open sexual communication and greater closeness than those that did not. Further, participants who were in relationships that were discordant in solitary pornography use reported more inhibited sexual communication and lower closeness than participants who were in relationships that were concordant in solitary pornography use. In fact, couples who were concordant in high-frequency solitary pornography use reported similar openness in sexual communication and closeness as couples in which neither partner used pornography alone. These findings have important implications for the field, because they reinforce the view that the links between pornography use and relationship health are largely a function of different patterns of pornography use within couples.","2018-05-01","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2020-10-18 17:38:23","2018-03-28 20:02:18","655-676","","4","35","","Journal of Social and Personal Relationships","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","00000  https://osf.io/kfb4z/register/564d31db8c5e4a7c9694b2be","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that participants staying in a dimly lit room (Studies 1 and 3–5) or wearing sunglasses (Study 2) tended to estimate a lower risk of catching contagious diseases from others than did those staying in a brightly lit room or wearing clear glasses. The effect persisted in both laboratory (Studies 1–4) and real-life settings (Study 5). The effect arises because visual darkness elevates perceived social distance from the contagion (Study 3) and is attenuated among abstract (vs. concrete) thinkers (Study 4).

One way that the visual signal facilitates speech recognition is by providing the listener with information about fine phonetic detail that complements information from the auditory signal. However, given that degraded face stimuli can still improve speech recognition accuracy (Munhall et al. in Perception & Psychophysics, 66(4), 574–583, 2004), and static or moving shapes can improve speech detection accuracy (Bernstein et al. in Speech Communication, 44(1/4), 5–18, 2004), aspects of the visual signal other than fine phonetic detail may also contribute to the perception of speech. In two experiments, we show that a modulating circle providing information about the onset, offset, and acoustic amplitude envelope of the speech does not improve recognition of spoken sentences (Experiment 1) or words (Experiment 2), but does reduce the effort necessary to recognize speech. These results suggest that although fine phonetic detail may be required for the visual signal to benefit speech recognition, low-level features of the visual signal may function to reduce the cognitive effort associated with processing speech.","2018-05-22","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2018-05-31 20:51:21","1-7","","","","","Psychon Bull Rev","Talking points","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have demonstrated a unique contribution of SBP, above other parenting styles, in predicting a range of wellbeing indicators in adolescents. Given that wellbeing supports learning, and SBP predicts wellbeing, it is also plausible that adolescents with strength-based parents will have greater academic achievement. At the beginning of term, students from a public secondary school in Australia (N = 741, Mage = 13.70, SD = 1.33; 50% female) completed a self-report survey measuring perceptions of parental style, engagement, and perseverance. Subsequent academic results were obtained 3 months later. SBP predicted higher wellbeing in the form of adolescent engagement and perseverance. SBP also demonstrated a significant effect on academic achievement which was mediated by perseverance, but not engagement. Thus, results supported a model in which adolescents with strength-based parents achieved higher grades via increased perseverance. Results reaffirm the importance of the parent-student link, and dispositional qualities of engagement and perseverance, in predicting educational outcomes such as grades. This study extends positive education research beyond the classroom by demonstrating that positive parenting techniques like SBP can predict student wellbeing and academic achievement.","2018-05-09","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2018-05-15 15:57:24","1-20","","","","","J Happiness Stud","Does Strength-Based Parenting Predict Academic Achievement?","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/mqkju/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observers judged the motion direction of a target stimulus, a Gaussian blob, that moved vertically upwards or downwards and then back to its initial position, just as observers made a saccade. We manipulated the onset and offset of the target and of distractors in various spatial relations to the target, and assessed their effect on performance and subjective confidence. Although the presence of the target after the saccade caused the strongest omission, the offset of spatially distant distractor stimuli upon saccade offset also impaired performance. The temporal properties of these two separate effects suggest that, in addition to masking, an independent effect of attentional distraction further accentuates perceptual omission of intra-saccadic motion streaks.","2018-05-19","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2020-10-18 17:38:22","2018-05-31 20:47:20","","","","","","Consciousness and Cognition","All is not lost","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/h56uj/","","","","","Backward masking; Eye movement; Intra-saccadic perception; Saccadic omission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, adding a third option can increase the probability of choosing a similar dominating option. This attraction effect is one of the most widely studied phenomena in decision-making research. Its prevalence, however, has been challenged recently by the tainting hypothesis, according to which the inferior option contaminates the attribute space in which it is located, leading to a repulsion effect.

In particular, we designed two tasks to test whether the surprise induced by outcomes that violate expectations enhances learning. Data from the first task revealed that asking participants to generate predictions, as compared to making post hoc evaluations, facilitated acquisition of geography knowledge. Pupillometry measurements revealed that expectancy-violating outcomes led to a surprise response only when a prediction was made beforehand, and that the strength of this response was positively related to the amount of learning. Data from the second task demonstrated that making predictions about the outcomes of soccer matches specifically improved memory for expectancy-violating events. These results suggest that a specific benefit of making predictions in learning contexts is that it creates the opportunity for the learner to be surprised.

Prior research shows that the feeling of effort shapes judgments (e.g., of agency) and decisions (e.g., to quit the current task) in various ways, but the proximal causes of the feeling of effort are not well understood. In this research, I address these proximal causes. In particular, I conducted two preregistered experiments in which participants performed a difficult vs. easy cognitive task, while I measured effort-related phenomenology (feeling of effort) and physiology (pupil dilation) on a moment-to-moment basis. In both experiments, difficult tasks increased the feeling of effort; however, this effect could not be explained by concurrent increases in physiological effort. To explain these findings, I suggest that the feeling of effort during mental activity stems from the decision to exert physiological effort, rather than from physiological effort itself.","2018-06-05","2020-10-18 17:38:18","2020-10-18 17:38:18","2018-06-12 19:42:20","","","","","","Consciousness and Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000","","","","","Consciousness; Effort; Feeling of effort; Phenomenology; Physiological effort; Pupil dilation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that, before the election, Republicans showed greater in-group favoritism than Democrats, who treated others equally, regardless of their political affiliation. We then show that Democrats experienced the election outcome as an ego shock and, in the week following the election, reported significantly higher levels of negative emotions and lower levels of self-esteem than Republicans. These reactions then predicted how individuals’ decided to allocate resources to others: after the election, Republicans no longer showed in-group favoritism, while Democrats showed out-group derogation.

Past research has demonstrated that the left-right divide in abortion support is in part explained by endorsement of sexist beliefs. Although informative, the generalizability of past findings is limited due to (unknown) sample representativeness and sampling procedure. Using the 2016 ANES U.S. nationally representative dataset (N = 3264), we tested the sexism-as-mediator of the left-right divide in abortion support hypothesis. We replicated previous findings, but the indirect effect of sexism was smaller than previously observed. Employing a multiple-groups analysis, we then examined whether the strength and direction of paths differed systematically by sex. Consistent with System Justification Theory (Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994), no sex differences emerged: Conservatism predicted lower support for abortion, in part through sexism, equally for men and women. Consistent with the highly polarized state of American politics, ideology emerged as a very relevant predictor of abortion support, trumping even group membership and self-interest.","2018-06-01","2020-10-18 17:38:18","2020-10-18 17:38:18","2018-02-06 14:34:15","22-25","","","127","","Personality and Individual Differences","Left-right differences in abortion policy support in America","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/ysyxz/register/57ace80a594d9000015403c6","","","","","Conservatism; System justification; Sex; Abortion; Sexism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study is one of the first to address this by comparing the demographic backgrounds of individuals in polyamorous (N = 2,428) and monogamous (N = 539) relationships in the United States. Compared to participants in monogamous relationships, those in polyamorous relationships were more likely to report minority sexual identities. Despite similar age distributions, individuals in polyamorous relationships were more likely to report being in a civil union, being divorced, and earning less than $40,000 per year compared to individuals in monogamous relationships. People in polyamorous relationships were also more likely to select “other” options for most demographic characteristics, suggesting that they tend to choose less traditional response options in general.

This low-level function could apply across frequency bands and potentially affect the temporal dynamics of experience. To test these possibilities a magnetoencephalography protocol was developed where capacity to form discrete auditory representations over time was assessed relative to oscillatory brain activity. Three sets of pre-registered analyses were conducted. First, the capacity to form representations correlated with the prevalence and durations of activity localized to the auditory cortex. Second, brain oscillations became entrained to stimuli over a broad range of frequencies. Finally, a sequence of gamma (γ) band events predicted successful discrete representation, where previous research had indicated similar individuation related differences within the alpha (α) range. Together, these findings indicate that a low-level function of cortical oscillations, which may apply across a range of frequency bands, is periodically to set conditions in which representational neuronal assemblies can manifest, limiting and so affecting the flow of experience.

Here, we study the heartbeat's role for active information sampling—testing whether humans implicitly act upon their environment so that relevant signals appear during preferred cardiac phases. During the encoding period of a visual memory experiment, participants clicked through a set of emotional pictures to memorize them for a later recognition test. By self-paced key press, they actively prompted the onset of short (100 ms) presented pictures. Simultaneously recorded electrocardiograms allowed us to analyze the self-initiated picture onsets relative to the heartbeat. We find that self-initiated picture onsets vary across the cardiac cycle, showing an increase during cardiac systole, while memory performance was not affected by the heartbeat. We conclude that active information sampling integrates heart-related signals, thereby extending previous findings on the association between body-brain interactions and behavior.","","2020-10-18 17:39:23","2020-10-18 17:39:23","2019-01-14 19:31:37","e13322","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00000  https://osf.io/5z8rx/","","","","","emotion; memory; cardiovascular; young adults; interoception; sensation/perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Involuntary elaborative cognitions differ from intrusive memories because they involve the construction of a novel scenario, rather than the retrieval of a specific past event. Presenting multiple, unrelated cues together—compared to isolated cues—might elicit more elaborative cognitions by encouraging the extraction of distinct memory traces to construct a novel event. Conversely, isolated cues might elicit more intrusive memories by encouraging retrieval of a specific memory. We investigated these ideas using a vigilance task consisting of written cues. Participants viewed negative photos and then viewed either no cues, single cues (e.g., knife), or cues presented together as randomly selected triplets (e.g., skull sick hunger). Cues encouraged involuntary cognitions. However, frequency of intrusive memories and involuntary elaborative cognitions did not depend on whether cues were presented singularly or as triplets.","","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2018-02-06 14:35:47","","","","","","Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","00000  https://osf.io/byq3b/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e","","","","","Trauma; Intrusions; Involuntary cognitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This manuscript reports direct replications of three key experiments reported by Ottati et al. 2015 in this journal in support of the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis. Consistent with the original findings, it was found that dogmatic behavior is considered substantially more appropriate for experts relative to novices (d = 0.45 [0.35, 0.55] over all replications and original study). In addition, it was confirmed that when participants envision themselves as experts they predict they will be more close-minded (d = − 0.54 [− 0.64, − 0.44]). Unfortunately, replications involving manipulation of expertise through task difficulty showed little to no effect on open-minded cognition (d = 0.00 [− 0.21, 0.21] for easy/difficult recall task; d = − 0.02 [− 0.21, 0.17] for easy/difficult trivia task). The balance of evidence suggests that the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is currently well-supported only for prospective manipulations of expertise that require participants to predict their social behaviors.

This was done to address a potential confound in the gold standard GF performance test, namely the spatial bias of the actors’ eye position that occurs when the actor turns the head to look at a target, offsetting the eye position from a centered position toward the attended target. Our results suggest that both 4.5 (n = 27) and 6 (n = 30)-month-old infants can follow an actor's gaze regardless of proximity.

Because there is consistent evidence that altruism and its mechanisms show cross-cultural variability, in the present paper we make the case for a cross-cultural perspective in blood donor research. Methods We analyse a subset of variables from a larger study, with samples drawn from seven countries (England, Malta, the Netherlands, Australia, the USA, Hungary, Italy: average N per country = 282). This subset of variables focuses on health (organ donor registration) and non-health (volunteering, donating money) philanthropy, family traditions of helping and moral outrage as predictors of blood donor status. Results We show two cross-cultural universals: (1) organ donor registration in opt-in countries is positively associated with blood donor status and (2) non-health philanthropy is generally unrelated to blood donor status. We also show two country-specific effects: (1) a family tradition for helping is associated with blood donor status in Italy only and (2) moral outrage is a predictor only in the USA. Conclusions We contend that these findings provide proof of principle why a cross-cultural perspective on blood donor behaviour is needed.","","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2018-11-19 14:57:51","","","0","0","","","Blood donor behaviour, motivations and the need for a systematic cross-cultural perspective","","","","","","","en","© 2018 International Society of Blood Transfusion","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00000  https://osf.io/5kzuu/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e","","","","","blood collection; donor motivation; donor psychology; donor recruitment; donors.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers have observed considerable covariation among these and other economic games, leading them to assert that there exists a general human propensity to cooperate that varies in strength across individuals and manifests itself across a variety of social settings. To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology","","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2020-10-18 17:39:22","2018-11-19 14:58:28","","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00001","","","","","cooperation; Trust Game; Dictator Game; S-1 bifactor model; social heuristics hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design and methods Study 1 was a correlational study (n = 117) in which participants completed measures of mindsets of fitness, physical exercise self-efficacy, fitness self-value and exercising frequency. In Study 2, an experimental study (N = 314), participants were randomly assigned to read a news article portraying fitness as either malleable (growth condition) or static (fixed condition). Participants again completed measures of mindsets, physical exercise self-efficacy, and fitness self-value as well as future exercise intentions. Results In Study 1, mindsets of fitness predicted exercise frequency, with stronger growth mindsets positively relating to self-reports of exercise frequency. And, self-efficacy and self-value mediated this relationship. In Study 2, we successfully manipulated fitness mindsets. Self-reported growth mindsets of fitness predicted greater exercise intentions and self-efficacy and self-value mediated this relationship. However, the manipulation failed to predict exercise intentions. Conclusions Study 1 provided initial support for the relationship between stronger growth mindsets of fitness and greater exercise efficacy, value and past exercise frequency.

Within-subject processes are proposed to explain between-subject associations of dispositional motives and relationship satisfaction. For an empirical test of the model, data on the dispositional partner-related need for communion and global relationship satisfaction were obtained from 152 individuals in heterosexual relationships. In an extensive experience sampling spanning 2 weeks, a subsample of 130 individuals answered questions about their current motivational states, mood, state relationship satisfaction, and experiences with their partner five times a day. The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model: (1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour; and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes.

The most common method of analysis has been the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM does not separate between-person effects from within-person effects, making it unclear whether the results from previous studies actually reflect the within-person effects or whether they reflect differences between people. We investigated the associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms at the within-person level, using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). To get an impression of the magnitude of possible differences between the RI-CLPM and the CLPM, we compared the results of both models. We used data from three longitudinal adolescent samples (age range: 7–18 years; study 1: N = 1948; study 2: N = 1455; study 3: N = 316). Intervals between the measurements were 1–1.5 years. Single-paper meta-analyses showed support for small within-person associations from self-esteem to depressive symptoms, but not the other way around, thus only providing some support for the vulnerability model. The cross-lagged associations in the aggregated RI-CLPM and CLPM showed similar effect sizes. Overall, our results show that over 1- to 1.5-year time intervals, low self-esteem may negatively influence depressive symptoms over time within adolescents, but only weakly so. © 2018 The Authors.

A recent study claims that ‘skilled musicians are not subject to’ this effect. It is not clear, however, if this is intended to mean that skilled musicians do not experience the McGurk effect at all, or if they just experience it to a lesser magnitude than non-musicians. The study also does not statistically demonstrate either of these conclusions, as it does report a numerical (albeit non-significant) McGurk effect for musicians and does not report a significant difference between musicians' and non-musicians’ McGurk effect sizes. This article reports a pre-registered, higher-power replication of that study (using twice the sample size and changing from a between- to a within-participants manipulation).

This study investigated whether people with obesity are blatantly dehumanized (i.e., explicitly considered to be less human and more animallike) and whether this predicts obesity discrimination. Methods In four online studies (total N = 1,506) with American, British, and Indian participants, evidence for blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was examined. Whether blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was moderated by BMI and to what extent blatant dehumanization predicted support for weight discrimination were also investigated. Results In all studies, participants believed that people with obesity were less evolved and less human than people without obesity. Although blatant dehumanization of people with obesity was most pronounced among thinner participants, the belief that people with obesity were less human was also observed among participants with class I obesity. Finally, dehumanization was predictive of support for policies that discriminate against people living with obesity.

We examine whether childhood and current exposure to violence are associated with memory (number of learning rounds needed to memorize relations between items) and reasoning performance (accuracy in deducing a novel relation) on transitive inference tasks involving both violence-relevant and violence-neutral social information (social dominance vs. chronological age). We hypothesized that individuals who had more exposure to violence would perform better than individuals with less exposure on the social dominance task. We tested this hypothesis in a preregistered study in 100 Dutch college students and 99 Dutch community participants. We found that more exposure to violence was associated with lower overall memory performance, but not with reasoning performance. However, the main effects of current (but not childhood) exposure to violence on memory were qualified by significant interaction effects. More current exposure to neighborhood violence was associated with worse memory for age relations, but not with memory for dominance relations. By contrast, more current personal involvement in violence was associated with better memory for dominance relations, but not with memory for age relations. These results suggest incomplete transfer of learning and memory abilities across contents. This pattern of results, which supports a combination of deficits and “hidden talents,” is striking in relation to the broader developmental literature, which has nearly exclusively reported deficits in people from harsh conditions.

The current research addresses the role of different threat types and emotional reactions in the context of refugee migration with a multi-method approach. Using qualitative (Study 1, N = 202) and quantitative (Studies 2-4, N = 873) methods, we identified six types of threat that majority group members in Germany experience in the face of refugee migration: Concerns about cultural differences (symbolic threat), financial strain (realistic threat), criminal acts (safety threat), conflicts within society (cohesion threat), increasing xenophobia (prejudice threat), and refugee care (altruistic threat). All these threat types elicited negative emotions and were associated with negative attitudes towards refugees and support for restrictive migration policies. Paradoxically, concerns about refugee care predicted support for restrictive migration policies particularly well (altruistic threat paradox), which can be explained by a lack of emotional responses to this type of threat. Based on these findings, we propose a bidirectional model of intergroup threat. This article is protected by copyright.

Specifically, compared to a projected range of outcomes (e.g. a global rise in temperature between 1.6°C and 2.4°C) by a certain point in time (the year 2065), Ballard & Lewandowsky (Ballard and Lewandowsky 2015 Phil.

Based on two new studies that showed a null effect between the two presentation formats, however, we recommend treating the projection statements featured in these studies as equivalent, and we encourage investigators to find alternative ways to improve on existing formats to communicate uncertain information about future events.","","2020-10-18 17:39:21","2020-10-18 17:39:21","2019-08-27 15:21:15","180475","","7","6","","Royal Society Open Science","Does ‘When’ really feel more certain than ‘If’?","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00000  https://osf.io/pcebv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two experiments investigated effects of exposure level and delay between learning and sleep on adults' consolidation of novel competitors (e.g. BANARA) to existing words (e.g. BANANA). Participants made speeded semantic decisions (i.e. a forced choice: natural versus man-made) to the existing words, with the expectation that novel word learning would inhibit responses due to lexical competition. This competition was observed, particularly when assessed after sleep, for both standard and high exposure levels (10 and 20 exposures per word; Experiment 1). Using a lower exposure level (five exposures; Experiment 2), no post-sleep enhancement of competition was observed, despite evidence of consolidation when explicit knowledge of novel word memory was tested. Thus, when encoding is relatively weak, consolidation-related lexical integration is particularly compromised. There was no evidence that going to bed soon after learning is advantageous for overnight consolidation; however, there was some preliminary suggestion that longer gaps between learning and bed-onset were associated with better explicit memory of novel words one week later, but only at higher levels of exposure. These findings suggest that while lexical integration can occur overnight, weaker lexical traces may not be able to access overnight integration processes in the sleeping brain. Furthermore, the finding that longer-term explicit memory of stronger (but not weaker) traces benefit from periods of wake following learning deserves examination in future research.","","2020-10-18 17:39:21","2020-10-18 17:39:21","2019-04-15 16:00:47","181842","","4","6","","Royal Society Open Science","Learning to live with interfering neighbours","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00000  https://osf.io/zntvp/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present article, we examine the role of cognitive flexibility as a correlate of long-term-oriented behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. In a first study (N = 143), we explored potential associations between multiple self-report scales and performance-based measures of cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Based on its results, we conducted a pre-registered confirmatory study (N = 264) focusing on the most promising correlations found in our exploratory study. This study generated conclusive support for a positive medium-sized correlation between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Exploratory hierarchical regression analyses further revealed that cognitive flexibility accounted for a small portion of variance in pro-environmental behaviour above and beyond the Big Five. While appearing robust on the level of self-reports, the relationship between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour did not reliably extend to the level of performance tasks, possibly because of their relatively specific scope.

Inverted comfort ratings might be used instead. Methods A fully remote app-based registered experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of a pain versus comfort diary on 7-day recall ratings of pain intensity during a 3-week period. The diary included questions about past, current and expected pain or comfort. Randomization took place by the study app, thereby controlling for effects of experimenter bias. Results Contrary to the study hypothesis, multilevel regression showed a more pronounced decrease in 7-day recall ratings of pain in the group who rated pain intensity daily (n = 184) than in the group who rated comfort daily (n = 205, B = −0.17, p = 0.034). There were no between-group differences in secondary outcomes (comfort, depressive symptoms, pain interference and happiness). Exploratory analyses revealed more pronounced decreases in pain intensity in participants who experienced less frequent pain in the previous 6 months. Correlations between pain and comfort ratings decreased from −0.39 at baseline to −0.06 after 3 weeks. Conclusions The findings do not support the potential beneficial effects of replacing diary ratings of pain intensity with diary ratings of comfort. The unexpected decreases among those who completed daily pain diaries might have been due to the inclusion of questions about expected pain. Decreasing correlations between pain and comfort ratings suggest that comfort ratings are not merely inverted pain ratings; rather, they appear to assess a domain distinct from pain intensity. Significance The positive effects of pain diaries on pain trajectories appear to constitute a reliable effect and not a methodological artefact. Pain diaries should be investigated systematically to identify ways to optimize their effects on clinical outcomes. Comfort diaries, however, do not appear to be an efficacious substitute for pain diaries; if the current findings replicate, they indicate that primary care practitioners should continue to use pain diaries in clinical care.","","2020-10-18 17:39:20","2020-10-18 17:39:20","2019-08-01 18:20:32","","","0","0","","","Pain vs. comfort diary","","","","","","","en","© 2019 European Pain Federation ‐ EFIC®","","","","Wiley Online Library","","00000  https://osf.io/gdztp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both protocols are presumed to be perceptually identical on the scalp, and thus represent an effective method of delivering double-blinded experimental designs. However, participants often show above-chance accuracy when asked which condition involved active/sham retrospectively. We assessed the time course of sham-blinding during active and sham tDCS. We predicted that participants would be aware that the current is switched on for longer in the active versus sham protocol. 32 adults were tested in a pre-registered, double-blinded, within-subjects design. A forced-choice reaction time task was undertaken before, during and after active (10min 1mA) and sham (20s 1mA) tDCS. The anode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (C3) to target the right hand, and the cathode on the right forehead. Two probe questions were asked every 30s: “Is the stimulation on? “and “How sure are you?”. Distinct periods of non-overlapping confidence intervals were identified between conditions, totalling 5min (57.1% of the total difference in stimulation time). These began immediately after sham ramp-down and lasted until the active protocol had ended. We therefore show a failure of placebo control during 1mA tDCS. These results highlight the need to develop more effective methods of sham-blinding during transcranial electrical stimulation protocols, even when delivered at low-intensity current strengths.

This value comparison process is also influenced by the amount of attention people allocate to different items. Recent research shows that choices for food items can be increased by training attention toward these items, with a paradigm named cued-approach training (CAT). However, previous work till now has only examined the influence of CAT on choices between two equally valued items. It has remained unclear whether CAT can increase choices for low value items when people choose between a low and high value food item. To address this question in the current study participants were cued to make rapid responses in CAT to certain low and high value items. Next, they made binary choices between low and high value items, where we systematically varied whether the low and high value items were cued or uncued. In two experiments, we found that participants overall preferred high over low value food items for real consumption. More important, their choices for low value items increased when only the low value item had been cued in CAT compared to when both low and high value items had not been cued. Exploratory analyses revealed that this effect was more pronounced for participants with a relatively small value difference between low and high value items. The present research thus suggests that CAT may be used to boost the choice and consumption of low value items via enhanced attention toward these items, as long as the value difference is not too large. Implications for facilitating choices for healthy food are discussed.","","2020-10-18 17:39:20","2020-10-18 17:39:20","2017-06-19 13:11:39","","","","","","Appetite","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: zoltak_attention!_???? https://osf.io/jte6q/ https://osf.io/s8cgm/","","","","","Attention; Food choice; Behavioral change; Cue-approach training; Value","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By presenting a single retrieval trial one hour before standard extinction training, they found an enduring reduction of fear. The retrieval-extinction procedure holds great clinical potential, particularly for anxiety patients, but the findings are not undisputed, and several conceptual replications have failed to reproduce the effect. These failures have largely been attributed to small procedural differences. This preregistered study is the first endeavor to exactly replicate three key experiments of the original report by Monfils et al. (2009), thereby gauging the robustness of their seminal findings. Despite adhering to the original procedures as closely as possible, we did not find any evidence for reduced return of fear with the retrieval-extinction procedure relative to regular extinction training, as assessed through spontaneous recovery, reinstatement and renewal. Behavior of animals in the control condition (extinction only) was comparable to that in the original studies and provided an adequate baseline to reveal differences with the retrieval-extinction condition. Our null findings indicate that the effect sizes in the original paper may have been inflated and question the legitimacy of previously proposed moderators of the retrieval-extinction effect. We argue that direct experimental evaluation of purported moderators of the retrieval-extinction effect will be key to shed more light on its nature and prerequisites.","","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2017-08-03 13:42:07","","","","","","Neurobiology of Learning and Memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: luyten_preregistered_????-1 https://osf.io/aydfs","","","","","Replication; behavioral updating; cued fear conditioning; post-retrieval amnesia; reconsolidation; retrieval-extinction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether (a) child and adolescent anxiety is positively or negatively associated with later alcohol use and disorders and (b) study characteristics explain inconsistencies in findings. Design and Setting We conducted a systematic review of 51 prospective cohort studies from 11 countries. Three studies contributed to a meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases, and studies were included if they met the following criteria: English language publication, human participants, anxiety exposure (predictor variable) in childhood or adolescence and alcohol outcome at least 6 months later. Participants Study sample sizes ranged from 110 to 11 157 participants. Anxiety exposure ages ranged from 3 to 24 years, and alcohol outcome ages ranged from 11 to 42 years. Measurements Ninety-seven associations across 51 studies were categorized by anxiety exposure (generalized anxiety disorder, internalizing disorders, miscellaneous anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobias) and alcohol use outcome (drinking frequency/quantity, binge drinking and alcohol use disorders). Findings The narrative synthesis revealed some evidence for a positive association between anxiety and later alcohol use disorders. Associations of anxiety with later drinking frequency/quantity and binge drinking were inconsistent. Type and developmental period of anxiety, follow-up duration, sample size and confounders considered did not appear to explain the discrepant findings. The meta-analysis also showed no clear evidence of a relationship between generalized anxiety disorder and later alcohol use disorder (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval = 0.47–1.87). Conclusions Evidence to date is suggestive, but far from conclusive of a positive association between anxiety during childhood and adolescence and subsequent alcohol use disorder.","","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2019-04-25 13:54:52","","","0","0","","","Associations of child and adolescent anxiety with later alcohol use and disorders","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Authors.

We review essential considerations in structural equation modeling and discuss how the initial study addressed these, then describe a conceptual replication with a South Korean sample of secondary school learners of English (N = 1,297). Our analysis of the scales from the initial study in addition to second language achievement found support for an alternative model where the Intended Effort scale showed a better fit as a predictor of motivation than as an outcome variable. Our findings suggest the need for greater precision and rigor in structural equation modeling research on second language learning motivation and for more language researchers to take up replication and other open science initiatives.

This may reflect an awareness of limited lifetime unique to humans, leading to a greater interest in maintaining social relationships at the expense of the non-social world in the face of limited cognitive and physical resources. Alternately, fundamental biological processes common to other primate species may direct preferential interest in social stimuli with increasing age. Inspired by a recent study that described a sustained interest in social stimuli but diminished interest in non-social stimuli in aged Barbary macaques, we carried out a conceptual replication to test whether old rhesus monkeys lost interest in non-social stimuli. Male and female macaques (Macaca mulatta; N = 243) 4–30 years old were tested with a food puzzle outfitted with an activity monitor to evaluate their propensity to manipulate the puzzle in order to free a food reward. We found no indication that aged monkeys were less interested in the puzzle than young monkeys, nor were they less able to solve it.","","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2019-12-23 19:50:27","182237","","9","6","","Royal Society Open Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testing this hypothesis, we asked participants to find an unfamiliar building and randomly assigned them to solve this everyday problem either with or without their smartphones. Compared to those who could not rely on technology, participants who used their smartphones found the building more easily but ended up feeling less socially connected. Although having access to smartphones improved participants’ mood by making their task easier, this beneficial effect was diminished by the costs to social connection.

We explore the impact of gossip accuracy on trust and trustworthiness in a population playing decentralized, two-player trust games. We observed non-trivial levels of spontaneous inaccuracy in gossip, and there was evidence that this was largely due to gossipers' desire to punish untrustworthy players. Although this endogenous inaccuracy did not adversely affect levels of trust and trustworthiness, introducing high levels of exogenous inaccuracy did. Importantly though, we observed greater trust and trustworthiness when highly inaccurate gossip was present than when communication was impossible. This suggests that even inaccurate gossip induces a degree of reputational concern in gossip targets and some willingness among gossip recipients to discriminate between partners on the basis of the gossip they received. Thus, gossip need not be perfectly accurate to effectively induce cooperation.","","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2017-10-16 13:56:50","","","","","","Games and Economic Behavior","Will any gossip do?","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Citation Key: fonseca_will_???? 00000  https://tinyurl.com/hc27ajw","","","","","Communication; Trust; Experiment; Gossip","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The literature is mixed, however, regarding the influence of the visual modality on the listening effort required to recognize speech (e.g., ; ). Here, we present data showing that even when the visual modality robustly benefits recognition, processing audiovisual speech can still result in greater cognitive load than processing speech in the auditory modality alone. We show using a dual-task paradigm that the costs associated with audiovisual speech processing are more pronounced in easy listening conditions, in which speech can be recognized at high rates in the auditory modality alone—indeed, effort did not differ between audiovisual and audio-only conditions when the background noise was presented at a more difficult level. Further, we show that though these effects replicate with different stimuli and participants, they do not emerge when effort is assessed with a recall paradigm rather than a dual-task paradigm. Together, these results suggest that the widely cited audiovisual recognition benefit may come at a cost under more favorable listening conditions, and add to the growing body of research suggesting that various measures of effort may not be tapping into the same underlying construct ().","","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-10-18 17:39:13","2020-03-20 15:34:28","","","1","2","","J Cogn","About Face","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","00000  https://osf.io/5yqe4","","","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6873894/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Newborns were assessed after birth via the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. We identified two newborn neurobehavioral factors—arousal and attention—via exploratory factor analysis. Low arousal was characterized by less irritability, excitability, and motor agitation, while low attention was related to a lower threshold for auditory and visual stimulation, less sustained attention, and poorer visual tracking abilities. Pregnant women who reported higher levels of emotion dysregulation had newborns with low arousal levels and less attention. Larger decreases in maternal RSA in response to cry were also related to lower newborn arousal.

The process of memory reconsolidation offers a mechanism to weaken such learning, potentially ameliorating over-eating behaviour. Here we investigated whether putatively interfering with synaptic plasticity using the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, could weaken retrieved chocolate reward memories through blockade of reconsolidationMethodsSeventy five healthy volunteers with a tendency to binge eat chocolate were randomised to retrieve chocolate reward memory under 10 mg rapamycin (RET + RAP, active condition), or placebo (RET + PBO), or they received 10 mg rapamycin without subsequent retrieval (NO RET + RAP). Indices of chocolate reward memory strength were assessed one week pre and post manipulation and at one month follow-up.ResultsContrary to hypotheses, the RET + RAP group did not show any greater reduction than control groups on indices of motivational salience of chocolate cues, motivation to consume chocolate or liking of chocolate. Mild evidence of improvement in the RET + RAP group was found, but this was limited to reduced chocolate binge episodes and improved healthy food choices.ConclusionsWe did not find convincing evidence of comprehensive naturalistic chocolate reward memory reconsolidation blockade by rapamycin. The effects on chocolate bingeing and food choices may warrant further investigation. These limited positive findings may be attributable to insufficient interference with mTOR signalling with 10 mg rapamycin, or failure to destabilise chocolate memories during retrieval.","undefined/ed","2020-10-18 17:39:12","2020-10-18 17:39:12","2020-03-18 15:23:43","1-10","","","","","","An assessment of rapamycin for weakening binge-eating memories via reconsolidation","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge Core","","https://osf.io/35v9g","","","","","memory; reward; Binge eating; obesity; reconsolidation; mTOR; overweight; rapamycin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, they argue and empirically support that when other coalitional information is present, the encoding of race is spectacularly reduced. In the present contribution, we present a replication of the race-erased effect reported by Kurzban et al. First, we give a detailed overview of the hypotheses, the experimental methodology, the derivation of the sample size required to achieve a power of 95%, and the criteria that need to be met for a successful replication. Then we present the findings of an empirical test that met the requirements of our power analyses.

In 1977, Amos Tversky published a highly influential feature-based model of how people judge the similarity between objects. The model highlights the context-dependence of similarity judgments, and challenged geometric models of similarity. One of the context-dependent effects Tversky describes is the diagnosticity principle. The diagnosticity principle determines which features are used to cluster multiple objects into subgroups. Perceived similarity between items within clusters is expected to increase, while similarity between items in different clusters decreases. Here, we present two pre-registered replications of the studies on the diagnosticity effect reported in Tversky (1977). Additionally, one alternative mechanism that has been proposed to play a role in the original studies, an increase in the choice for distractor items (a substitution effect, see Medin et al., 1995), is examined.

The effect implies that the well documented wisdom of the crowd effect—the crowd's average estimate tends to be more accurate than the individual estimates—can be obtained within a single individual. In this paper, we performed a high-powered, pre-registered replication study of the original experiment. Our replication results are evaluated with the traditional null hypothesis significance testing approach, as well as with effect sizes and their confidence intervals. We adopted a co-pilot approach, in the sense that all analyses were performed independently by two researchers using different analysis software. Moreover, we report Bayes factors for all tests. We successfully replicated the crowd within effect, both when the second guess was made immediately after the first guess, as well as when it was made 3 weeks later.

Because this effect does not fit with Asch?s Gestalt-view on impression formation and does not readily follow from the data presented in his original paper, the goal of the present study was to critically examine and replicate the studies of Asch?s paper that are most relevant to the primacy-of-warmth effect.

In this study, we investigated whether the removal of outliers in psychology papers is related to weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect), a higher prevalence of reporting errors, and smaller sample sizes in these papers compared to papers in the same journals that did not report the exclusion of outliers from the analyses.      Methods and Findings   We retrieved a total of 2667 statistical results of null hypothesis significance tests from 153 articles in main psychology journals, and compared results from articles in which outliers were removed (N = 92) with results from articles that reported no exclusion of outliers (N = 61). We preregistered our hypotheses and methods and analyzed the data at the level of articles. Results show no significant difference between the two types of articles in median  p  value, sample sizes, or prevalence of all reporting errors, large reporting errors, and reporting errors that concerned the statistical significance. However, we did find a discrepancy between the reported degrees of freedom of  t  tests and the reported sample size in 41% of articles that did not report removal of any data values. This suggests common failure to report data exclusions (or missingness) in psychological articles.      Conclusions   We failed to find that the removal of outliers from the analysis in psychological articles was related to weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect), sample size, or the prevalence of errors. However, our control sample might be contaminated due to nondisclosure of excluded values in articles that did not report exclusion of outliers. Results therefore highlight the importance of more transparent reporting of statistical analyses.","2014-07-29","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2016-05-18 18:35:02","e103360","","7","9","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Citation Key: bakker_outlier_2014 00000","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\6Q5VQV89\article.html","","","Psychology; Forecasting; Statistical data; Test statistics; Cognitive psychology; Experimental psychology; Research errors; Social psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such interventions typically compare improvements from these interventions to an active control group in which participants engage in non-aerobic activities (typically stretching and toning) for an equivalent amount of time. However, in the absence of a double-blind design, the presence of an active control group does not necessarily control for placebo effects; participants might expect different amounts of improvement for the treatment and control interventions  [1] . We conducted a large survey to explore whether people expect greater cognitive benefits from an aerobic exercise intervention compared to a control intervention. If participants expect greater improvement following aerobic exercise, then the benefits of such interventions might be due in part to a placebo effect. In general, expectations did not differ between aerobic and non-aerobic interventions. If anything, some of the results suggest the opposite (e.g., respondents expected the control, non-aerobic intervention to yield bigger memory gains). These results provide the first evidence that cognitive improvements following aerobic fitness training are not due to differential expectations.","2014-10-07","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2016-08-31 16:04:38","e109557","","10","9","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Citation Key: stothart_is_2014 https://osf.io/brmvq/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\3ZCU8FMR\article.html","","","Cognition; memory; Exercise; Video games; Reaction time; Games; Aerobic exercise; Physical fitness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These results suggested that 1/f noise in racial bias tasks reflected an effortful deliberative process, providing new insights regarding the mechanisms underlying implicit racial biases. Given the potential theoretical and applied importance of understanding the psychological processes underlying implicit racial biases – and in light of the growing demand for independent direct replications of findings to ensure the cumulative nature of our science – we attempted to replicate Correll’s finding in two high-powered studies. Despite considerable effort to closely duplicate all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i.e., same cover story, experimental manipulation, implicit measure task, original stimuli, task instructions, sampling frame, population, and statistical analyses), both replication attempts were unsuccessful in replicating the original finding challenging the theoretical account that 1/f noise in racial bias tasks reflects a deliberative process. However, the emission of 1/f noise did consistently emerge across samples in each of our conditions. Hence, future research is needed to clarify the psychological significance of 1/f noise in racial bias tasks.","2014-11-11","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2020-10-18 17:39:11","2016-08-31 16:48:57","1135-1141","","4","22","","Psychon Bull Rev","Making sense of the noise","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/v3hfb/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\FZ56WEPK\s13423-014-0757-4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most previous experimental studies have been done with college students, not youth. The current study examined the impact of VVGs in an experimental study of teens (12–18). Participants were randomized to play either a violent or non-violent video game. Teens also reported their levels of stress and hostility both before and after video game play. Hostility levels neither decreased nor increased following violent game play, and Bayesian analyzes confirmed that results are supportive of the null hypothesis. By contrast, VVG exposure increased stress, but only for girls. The impact of VVGs on teen hostility is minimal. However, players unfamiliar with such games may find them unpleasant. These results are put into the context of Uses and Gratifications Theory with suggestions for how medical professionals should address the issue of VVG play with concerned parents.","2015-04-21","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2016-08-31 16:51:34","49-56","","1","87","","Psychiatr Q","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","https://osf.io/vn3zk/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\PIWDHEFT\s11126-015-9361-7.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reports a pre-registered exact replication of Study 3 from this original paper and finds, consistent with the original study, that Americans substantially overestimate social class mobility, that people provide greater overestimates when made while thinking of similar others, and that high perceived social class is related to greater overestimates. The current results provide additional evidence consistent with the idea that people overestimate class mobility to protect their beliefs in the promise of equality of opportunity. Discussion considers the utility of pre-registered self-replications as one tool for encouraging replication efforts and assessing the robustness of effect sizes.","2015","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2016-05-18 18:46:20","1709","","","","","Front.

Bridging research on social cognition and deception detection, we hypothesized that observing a liar compared to a truth-teller would decrease finger skin temperature of observers. Participants first watched two targets while not forewarned that they would later be asked to judge (direct and indirect) veracity, and then watched another two targets while forewarned about this. During both these phases finger skin temperature was measured. Findings pertaining to temperature partly confirmed our main hypothesis. When participants were observing a liar, irrespective of being forewarned, on average finger skin temperature declined over time. In the forewarned phase, temperature trajectories of truth-tellers were higher than those of liars, however, in the not forewarned phase, this pattern was reversed. Results confirmed our further hypotheses that participants judge liars as less likeable and less trustworthy than truth-tellers—an indication of indirect deception detection. Our hypothesis that the effect size for trustworthiness would be bigger than that of liking was not supported by the data. Additionally, and also confirming our hypothesis, participants performed around chance level when directly judging whether the target person was lying. Exploratory analyses are reported with regard to truth bias and dependency between direct and indirect veracity judgments. Limitations and directions for future work related to the existence of psychophysiological indicators of deception detection are discussed.","2015-06-08","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2020-10-18 17:39:10","2016-08-31 17:04:07","672","","","","","Front.

Critically, we assessed whether distance moderates the relationship between age and noticing. We replicated both age and distance effects, but found no age by distance interaction. These findings disconfirm a plausible explanation for age differences in noticing (restricted field of view), while for the first time highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using Mechanical Turk for the study of cognitive aging.","2015-10-01","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2016-08-31 16:50:37","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

We conducted two high-powered direct replications of the effects of power on golf, two online conceptual replications using mirror-tracing as a performance measure, and an additional conceptual replication using a cognitive performance measure (word-search). Overall, we found little to no effect of power on motor skill ( d  = 0.09, 95% CI[-0.07, 0.22],  n  = 603). We varied task difficulty, re-analyzed data without participants showing weak responses on manipulation checks, and tried adjusting performance scores for age, gender, and initial task skill. None of these secondary analyses revealed a strong effect of power on performance. A meta-analysis integrating our data with Burgmer &amp; Englich leaves open the possibility that manipulating power could provide a modest boost in motor skill ( d  = 0.19, 95% CI [0.001, 0.38],  n  = 685). Unfortunately, the pattern of performance changes we observed was unrelated to group differences in perceived and rated power, suggesting that what motor effects do occur with this protocol may not be directly related to the construct of power.

In the present research, we provided the first examination of people’s momentary happiness while consuming these purchases. Participants were randomly assigned to spend C$20 on a material versus experiential purchase (Study 1) or to report a material versus experiential gift they received at Christmas (Study 2); participants in both studies reported their momentary happiness regarding these purchases over 2 weeks, using daily-diary (Study 1) and experience-sampling (Study 2) methodologies. Results suggest that material and experiential purchases deliver happiness in two distinct flavors: Material purchases provide more frequent momentary happiness over time, whereas experiential purchases provide more intense momentary happiness on individual occasions.","2015-11-30","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2016-08-31 15:40:25","1948550615619761","","","","","Social Psychological and Personality Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","spp.sagepub.com","","Citation Key: weidman_unsung_2015 osf.io/ixgas osf.io/p2fvg","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\AMQUJ2US\1948550615619761.html","","","well-being; happiness; Decision making; money; experiential purchases; material purchases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that individual differences in analytic thought are associated with reduced religious beliefs particularly when analytic thought is measured (hence, primed) first. The current study provides a direct replication of prior evidence that individual differences in analytic thinking are negatively related to religious beliefs when analytic thought is measured before religious beliefs. When religious belief is measured before analytic thinking, however, the negative relationship is reduced to non-significance, suggesting that the link between analytic thought and religious belief is more tenuous than previously reported. The current study suggests that whereas inducing analytic processing may reduce religious belief, more analytic thinkers are not necessarily less religious. The potential for measurement order to inflate the inverse correlation between analytic thinking and religious beliefs deserves additional consideration.","2015-09-24","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2020-10-18 17:39:01","2016-08-31 16:47:58","e0138922","","9","10","","PLOS ONE","Revisiting the Relationship between Individual Differences in Analytic Thinking and Religious Belief","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Citation Key: finley_revisiting_2015 https://osf.io/v34gw/","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\EPSAJRXE\article.html","","","Cognition; Sports; Religion; open science; Sense of agency; Reasoning; Regression analysis; Reflection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
