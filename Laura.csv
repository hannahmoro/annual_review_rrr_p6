S.; Albiero, Paolo; Cubelli, Roberto","Questionable research practices among Italian research psychologists","PLoS ONE","","1932-6203(Electronic)","","","A survey in the United States revealed that an alarmingly large percentage of university psychologists admitted having used questionable research practices that can contaminate the research literature with false positive and biased findings. We conducted a replication of this study among Italian research psychologists to investigate whether these findings generalize to other countries. All the original materials were translated into Italian, and members of the Italian Association of Psychology were invited to participate via an online survey. The percentages of Italian psychologists who admitted to having used ten questionable research practices were similar to the results obtained in the United States although there were small but significant differences in self-admission rates for some QRPs. Nearly all researchers (88%) admitted using at least one of the practices, and researchers generally considered a practice possibly defensible if they admitted using it, but Italian researchers were much less likely than US researchers to consider a practice defensible. Participants' estimates of the percentage of researchers who have used these practices were greater than the self-admission rates, and participants estimated that researchers would be unlikely to admit it. In written responses, participants argued that some of these practices are not questionable and they have used some practices because reviewers and journals demand it. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this study, and a related study conducted in Germany suggest that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes.

This social network method, called the generalized network scale-up method, acts to reduce selection bias by accessing the population of interest via the social networks of participants.

Discussions about changes in practices such as posting data and pre-registering analyses have been marked by controversy—including controversy over the extent to which change has taken place. This study, based on the State of Social Science (3S) Survey, provides the first comprehensive assessment of awareness of, attitudes towards, perceived norms regarding, and adoption of open science practices within a broadly representative sample of scholars from four major social science disciplines: economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. We observe a steep increase in adoption: as of 2017, over 80% of scholars had used at least one such practice, rising from one quarter a decade earlier. Attitudes toward research transparency are on average similar between older and younger scholars, but the paceof change differs by field and methodology. According with theories of normal science and scientific change, the timing of increases in adoption coincides with technological innovations and institutional policies. Patterns are consistent with most scholars underestimating the trend toward open science in their discipline.","2019-10-18","2020-07-27 15:05:01","2020-07-27 15:05:06","2020-07-08 09:52:10","","","","","","","Open Science Practices are on the Rise","","","","","MetaArXiv","","","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.31222/osf.io/5rksu","<p>N ~ 2800 social scientists (various career stages) from April to August 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Against this backdrop, policy makers are increasingly advocating for making research data and supporting material openly available online. Despite its potential to further scientific progress, widespread data sharing in small science is still an ideal practised in moderation. In this article, we explore the question of what drives open access to research data using a survey among 1564 mainly German researchers across all disciplines. We show that, regardless of their disciplinary background, researchers recognize the benefits of open access to research data for both their own research and scientific progress as a whole. Nonetheless, most researchers share their data only selectively. We show that individual reward considerations conflict with widespread data sharing. Based on our results, we present policy implications that are in line with both individual reward considerations and scientific progress.","2017-06-20","2020-07-27 15:07:35","2020-07-27 15:07:35","2020-06-30 09:31:05","1-10","","1","3","","","A reputation economy","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","","","","Disciplines, all; Germany; n=1564; Researchers; Survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigate whether researchers’ personal motivation (expressed by achievement goals) is associated with self-reported engagement in QRPs within a sample of 217 psychology researchers. Appearance approach goals (striving for skill demonstration) positively predicted engagement in QRPs, while learning approach goals (striving for skill development) were a negative predictor. These effects remained stable when also considering Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy in a latent multiple regression model. Additional moderation analyses revealed that the more researchers favored publishing over scientific rigor, the stronger the association between appearance approach goals and engagement in QRPs.

From May to December 2011 we searched 35 bibliographic databases, five grey literature databases and hand searched nine journals for potentially relevant studies. We included surveys that asked scientists if, in a given recall period, they had committed or knew of a colleague who committed plagiarism, and from each survey extracted the proportion of those who reported at least one case. Studies that focused on academic (i.e. student) plagiarism were excluded. Literature searches returned 12,460 titles from which 17 relevant survey studies were identified. Meta-analysis of studies reporting committed (N = 7) and witnessed (N = 11) plagiarism yielded a pooled estimate of, respectively, 1.7 % (95 % CI 1.2–2.4) and 30 % (95 % CI 17–46). Basic methodological factors, including sample size, year of survey, delivery method and whether survey questions were explicit rather than indirect made a significant difference on survey results. Even after controlling for these methodological factors, between-study differences in admission rates were significantly above those expected by sampling error alone and remained largely unexplained. Despite several limitations of the data and of this meta-analysis, we draw three robust conclusions: (1) The rate at which scientists report knowing a colleague who committed plagiarism is higher than for data fabrication and falsification; (2) The rate at which scientists report knowing a colleague who committed plagiarism is correlated to that of fabrication and falsification; (3) The rate at which scientists admit having committed either form of misconduct (i.e. fabrication, falsification and plagiarism) in surveys has declined over time.","2015-10-01","2020-07-27 21:06:48","2020-07-27 21:06:48","2020-07-27 21:06:48","1331-1352","","5","21","","Sci Eng Ethics","Scientists Admitting to Plagiarism","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In moderately or poorly developed countries such as Croatia, data on research misconduct are scarce. The primary aim of this study was to determine the rates at which scientists report committing or observing the most serious forms of research misconduct, such as falsification, fabrication, plagiarism, and violation of authorship rules in the Croatian scientific community. Additionally, we sought to determine the degree of development and the extent of implementation of the system for defining and regulating research misconduct in a typical scientific community in Croatia. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed among 1232 Croatian scientists at the University of Rijeka in 2012/2013 and 237 (19.2 %) returned the survey. Based on the respondents who admitted having committed research misconduct, 9 (3.8 %) admitted to plagiarism, 22 (9.3 %) to data falsification, 9 (3.8 %) to data fabrication, and 60 (25.3 %) respondents admitted to violation of authorship rules. Based on the respondents who admitted having observed research misconduct of fellow scientists, 72 (30.4 %) observed plagiarism, 69 (29.1 %) observed data falsification, 46 (19.4 %) observed data fabrication, and 132 (55.7 %) respondents admitted having observed violation of authorship rules. The results of our study indicate that the efficacy of the system for managing research misconduct in Croatia is poor. At the University of Rijeka there is no document dedicated exclusively to research integrity, describing the values that should be fostered by a scientist and clarifying the forms of research misconduct and what constitutes a questionable research practice. Scientists do not trust ethical bodies and the system for defining and regulating research misconduct; therefore the observed cases of research misconduct are rarely reported. Finally, Croatian scientists are not formally educated about responsible conduct of research at any level of their formal education. All mentioned indicate possible reasons for higher rates of research misconduct among Croatian scientists in comparison with scientists in highly developed countries.","2017-02-01","2020-07-31 19:46:56","2020-07-31 19:47:01","2020-07-31 19:46:54","165-181","","1","23","","Sci Eng Ethics","Research Misconduct in the Croatian Scientific Community","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","croatia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we sent an e-mail invitation to participate in an anonymous computer-based survey to all university researchers having received a biomedical research grant or scholarship from one of the two national academic research funders of Belgium between 2010 and 2014, and to researchers working in large biomedical companies or spin-offs in Belgium. The validated survey included questions about various types of research misconduct committed by respondents themselves and observed among their colleagues in the last three years. Prevalences of misconduct were compared between university and industry respondents using binary logistic regression models, with adjustments for relevant personal characteristics, and with significance being accepted for p < 0.01. The survey was sent to 1766 people within universities and an estimated 255 people from industry. Response rates were 43 (767/1766) and 48% (123/255), and usable information was available for 617 and 100 respondents, respectively. In general, research misconduct was less likely to be reported by industry respondents compared to university respondents. Significant differences were apparent for one admitted action (gift authorship) and three observed actions (plagiarism, gift authorship, and circumventing animal-subjects research requirements), always with lower prevalences for industry compared to universities, except for plagiarism. This survey, based on anonymous self-report, shows that research misconduct occurs to a substantial degree among biomedical researchers from both industry and universities.","2018-12","2020-07-31 18:56:02","2020-07-31 18:56:08","2020-07-31 18:56:02","1697-1717","","6","24","","","Scientists Still Behaving Badly?","","","","","","","English","Science and Engineering Ethics is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

We surveyed journal editors to determine their views about a range of publication ethics issues. Methods: Questionnaire sent to 524 editors-in-chief of Wiley-Blackwell science journals asking about the severity and frequency of 16 ethical issues at their journals, their confidence in handling such issues, and their awareness and use of guidelines. Results: Responses were obtained from 231 editors (44%), of whom 48% edited healthcare journals. The general level of concern about the 16 issues was low, with mean severity scores of <1 (on a scale of 0–3) for all but one. The issue of greatest concern (mean score 1.19) was redundant publication. Most editors felt confident in handling the issues, with <15% feeling “not at all confident” for all but one of the issues (gift authorship, 22% not confident). Most editors believed such problems occurred less than once a year and >20% of the editors stated that 12 of the 16 items never occurred at their journal. However, 13%–47% did not know the frequency of the problems. Awareness and use of guidelines was generally low. Most editors were unaware of all except other journals’ instructions. Conclusions: Most editors of science journals seem not very concerned about publication ethics and believe that misconduct occurs only rarely in their journals. Many editors are unfamiliar with available guidelines but would welcome more guidance or training.","2009-06-01","2020-07-31 15:09:03","2020-07-31 15:09:03","2020-07-31 15:09:03","348-353","","6","35","","","Science journal editors’ views on publication ethics","","","","","","","en","2009 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and the Institute of Medical Ethics","","","","jme.bmj.com","","Publisher: Institute of Medical Ethics Section: Paper PMID: 19482976","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\WZY6RDK8\348.html; ; C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\WVYCD76N\Wager et al. - 2009 - Science journal editors’ views on publication ethi.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19482976","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its influence on the occurrence of research misbehavior has never been studied. This study aims to determine the association between personality traits and self-reported questionable research practices and research misconduct. We hypothesized that narcissistic, Machiavellianistic and psychopathic traits as well as self-esteem are associated with research misbehavior. Methods Included in this cross-sectional study design were 535 Dutch biomedical scientists (response rate 65%) from all hierarchical layers of 4 university medical centers in the Netherlands. We used validated personality questionnaires such as the Dark Triad (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, the Publication Pressure Questionnaire (PPQ), and also demographic and job-specific characteristics to investigate the association of personality traits with a composite research misbehavior severity score. Findings Machiavellianism was positively associated (beta 1.28, CI 1.06–1.53) with self-reported research misbehavior, while narcissism, psychopathy and self-esteem were not. Exploratory analysis revealed that narcissism and research misconduct were more severe among persons in higher academic ranks (i.e., professors) (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively), and self-esteem scores and publication pressure were lower (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) as compared to postgraduate PhD fellows. Conclusions Machiavellianism may be a risk factor for research misbehaviour. Narcissism and research misbehaviour were more prevalent among biomedical scientists in higher academic positions. These results suggest that personality has an impact on research behavior and should be taken into account in fostering responsible conduct of research.","2016-09-29","2020-07-30 22:28:00","2020-07-30 22:28:00","2020-07-30 22:28:00","e0163251","","9","11","","PLOS ONE","Personality Traits Are Associated with Research Misbehavior in Dutch Scientists","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\6NLGCSLN\article.html; C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\D3NBWUMF\Tijdink et al. - 2016 - Personality Traits Are Associated with Research Mi.pdf","","","Behavior; Personality disorders; Personality tests; Personality traits; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Scientific misconduct; Scientists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the authors present and analyze the results that they obtained after reviewing documents produced by professors and students of six postgraduate programs that are taught in two Mexican public universities. At the same time, the authors examine some of the practices that take place within said programs, given the institutional demands of improving finished studies efficiency. One of the hypotheses of this work is the demands that are imposed by external evaluations of academic processes on professors and their programs in order to reach desirable rates with the purpose of maintaining or increasing the levels of productivity, gives way to certain practices that must be analyzed.

Spectacular cases of scientific misconduct have 					contributed to concerns about the validity of published results in psychology. 					In our systematic review, we identified 16 studies reporting prevalence 					estimates of scientific misconduct and questionable research practices (QRPs) in 					psychological research. Estimates from these studies varied due to differences 					in methods and scope. Unlike other disciplines, there was no reliable lower 					bound prevalence estimate of scientific misconduct based on identified cases 					available for psychology. Thus, we conducted an additional empirical 					investigation on the basis of retractions in the database PsycINFO. Our analyses 					showed that 0.82 per 10,000 journal articles in psychology were retracted due to 					scientific misconduct. Between the late 1990s and 2012, there was a steep 					increase. Articles retracted due to scientific misconduct were identified in 20 					out of 22 PsycINFO subfields. These results show that measures aiming to reduce 					scientific misconduct should be promoted equally across all psychological 					subfields.","2019-01-01","2020-08-03 20:45:25","2020-08-03 20:45:36","2020-08-03 20:45:25","53-63","","1","227","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","econtent.hogrefe.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: Hogrefe Publishing","","C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\3KZ9N6T3\a000356.html; C:\Users\hmosh\Zotero\storage\6E6TCADA\Stricker and Günther - 2019 - Scientific Misconduct in Psychology.pdf","","review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
